.  You know what I think is funny?  People running for President accusing each other of being rich because of how much they spend.  This race may not be what you think.
I like Elizabeth Warren.  Have people in common.
Not going anywhere 😀

Yes
They will go back and forth.  Appreciate the support a great deal.  Changes are necessary.
They will go back and forth.  Different situations lead to different interpretations.
They will go both ways.  Different values ​trying to impose its way into different contexts.
Thanks Jordan.  Let’s try and make it happen.
He’s entitled to his opinion.  But I hope to address the issues that got him elected in the first place.  👍
If Paris was a video game it would be called “The End Of The Tour” and it would be terrible.
Thanks Zach.  Would love that.  👍
I like it.  We can do much better than that for new parents.  👍🙏
Do our best to decelerate and defuse these devices.  They can hurt people.  They are cheap compared to the costs of climate catastrophe.
Thanks Zach.  Does anyone else feel like they are flying blind?
We will get there.  👍
Just found out the new Avengers is 3 hours long - looks like they are going out in style.
Thanks James.  Let’s fix it.  👍
Thanks Nate.  Let’s fix it.  👍
Dear Lord only a few percent of Americans are endowed with divine rights.  We are the ones who have to decide.
Just found out the new Doctor Strange is very good.  I can’t wait to see him in person.  #pride 🇺🇸
He’s very good Guy.  👍🥊
On the plane to IA for some campaigning - see you soon Iowa!  👍😀🇺🇸
Ooh I love my chances of making the debates in June.  I think the hashtag movement has taken off in the last 3 months.  Going to be fierce.
Iowa has always been a bit of a bellwether state.  We have been talking about dropping out of the polls for quite some time.  As someone who has been polling there every day this goes to me as a bit of a sign.
Apparently the devil is in the details.  If you are polling at 3% or better in a GOP poll you are doing something right.
We have shifted gears and are looking at doing something a bit more intimate in New Hampshire.  Got to get some good stuff going.  That first debate is on NBC on June 19th and 20th. Let’s show what we can do.  👍🇺🇸
The #YangGang is pretty much unstoppable.  If you believe in humanity you should embrace this campaign.  😀🥊👏
Some candidates get more personal support than others.  Some get more standing ovations.  Some get more name recognition.

Someone told me that standing ovations count too.  Thanks Micah.  Alyssa!  👍😀🇺🇸
Someone said to me last night “If I had a hammer I would use it on every nook and cranny of this campaign.”  Inspiring.
This debate both flew by and was 2 hours long
Only has a few minutes left.  Let’s make it last as many as possible.  👍🥊😀
You know what was awesome?  Seeing MATH hats at the event.  Way to warm up our community!  :)
Who knew @perrybaconjr would one day become a household name.  When you think about how far he has come in just a short time you realize just how many doors remain to be closed.
Perry pointed out that there are many ways to legalize marijuana in Massachusetts.  Right now there’s a real shortage of doctors.  Hopefully the right policies can address this.
I think zoning can be made more liberal.  Need more people who see the inherent problems of capitalism and communism.  People should be able to buy homes and start businesses without being a capitalist or communist.  This is already happening.  Now we
