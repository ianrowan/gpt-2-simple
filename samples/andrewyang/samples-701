Thanks @wraycodesign  - great to hear you were  great  T.S.
Thanks @LouFoglia great to hear your story.  Always learning.
That s right folks.  We are going to have to do it ourselves.
Thanks Neil - look forward to working with you on this.  Cheers!
Yes it does 👍
And for those who are wondering the answer is Corey.
Thanks Mike.  The goals are aligned.  👍
Anyone who believes Universal Basic Income is inevitable knows it will happen.  Those who question it is proof of how much support there is.
Thank you Barbara!
Yes it is

Ha thanks.  Someone just suggested to me.  😀
I don’t read the works of ECO Frank or GRANT the economist.  Too much guesswork involved.
Thanks Dan.  This is the direction the country is headed.  Welcome to the real work.
For what it’s worth I watch Cosmos together.  Making the debates in June is a great goal.
Thanks George.  Getting some great guests too!  👍
Yes it is.  👍
For what it’s worth I think that Citizens United is a terrible idea. It’s over.  We need to roll it back as fast as possible.
Thank you Mike!
Thanks Dan!
Just committed.  3% of Americans get their news from a source other than a newspaper.  That’s a huge difference from being a pauper.
Thank you Doug 👍
Thank you!
Yes that is an issue.  I hear you.  👍
Thanks Tim!
It’s an issue, but it’s going to be a long one.  Citizens United was a terrible idea and I support the right of citizens to air grievances publicly.
Don’t think so
Thanks Nathan.  See you in NH.
Thank you Frank!  😀👍
Thank you!
This is messed up.  We are the richest most advanced country in the history of the world.  We can do much better than this.  We are cursed.
Yes it is.  Curse it.  👍
The owners of American companies should be able to tell their workers what to do.  Shouldn’t be able to unionize and organize.
Glad to be there John 👍
Citizens!
Citizens!
This debate stage is a big one.  All 8 debates will be breaking news.  👍
Yes it is.  Working on it.
Wow @Zach_Graumann is a good sport.  Sometimes a squeeze on the arm.  @cspan
Thanks Mike.  Didn’t mean to be negative.  I believe there are millions of Americans who are not plugged into the economy.  This is going to change.  It’s going to be the 20th economy.
Maybe add Indian food and I finish my sentence
I love progress 👍
Thank you!!  😀
This should be an issue.  If we ignore it our children will suffer.
Yes
It should.  The wealthy got richer and the rest of us poorer.  That’s a natural progression.  And it’s accelerated in real life.
Yes it is.  The goal is to provide a floor for everyone.  If that’s the plan we are good to go.  😀👍
Not going anywhere.  This is the direction the country is going.  @PhilipKHoward
Thanks Nick - see you soon.
No.  This is not the future of work.  We need to think much bigger about how to make money when people are working as hard as possible.
Yes
Robust worker pays are needed across state lines.
For-profit schools are among the worst - chains are not hands-off.
Yes
Thanks Daniel

Thanks Daniel
This race may be humans Vs. machines in more ways than one.
Welfare cheats go to jail more often than anyone realizes.  We need to make it harder for people to get welfare.
I’m not here to raise awareness.  I’m here to do a job.  Let’s go get it.
This may be the most important job in the country.  Let’s raise the next million or so.  👍🇺🇸
If we sit here and wish for Americans to get well we will do it ourselves.  If we act quickly we can improve the lives of countless Americans.
Many great things could come out of this campaign including the
