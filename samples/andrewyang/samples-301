. I'm getting stronger all the time.  😀👍
Thanks for this
I always believed that the game is unfair.  Yet we keep putting up barriers to entry.  Is this really what our economy needs?
Thanks Jason 👍
The 4th Industrial Revolution and the automation of jobs is about to extend well beyond factory jobs.  We need to develop new and different kinds of work.
Thanks Greg 👍
Thanks Alexis!!  😀👍🥊
I had a feeling that Bernie Sanders would find a way to connect with millions of working Americans and get something real done.  There were some bumps in the road along the way - but even I predicted a rout.  It didn’t happen like that.
You should know that you are doing exactly what is on the horizon - and getting stronger all the time.  It's the most powerful thing around.
Thanks for this
Great to hear it Chris.  So glad you think so.  😀👍🇺🇸
Running for President is not easy.  I was even wrestling on the sidelines for a while.  My foot slipped.  It was awful.  But I got up and did it.  I promise it’s worth it.
It’s true - human beings have always been at the center of the economy.  We need to make that clear.
People on disability will be the backbone of the economy for decades to come.  We can make major changes.  What is necessary is political will.  The sooner we get that the better.  The sooner we get major changes the better.  The longer this campaign tops out the better.
Thanks Patrick.  Hope to see you in New Hampshire.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks David!!  😀👍😀
Thanks Brian.  Hope to be back soon.  👍🇺🇸
I was very impressed by MATH 👍👏 by the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.  I think the American public is getting a lot out of this campaign.  If you dig in you find some very nice people.  Will be exciting.  👍🇺🇸
It’s true - we can and should do more of the former.  The world is a much better place for it.
Hope to be back soon 👍😀🇺🇸
I have been listening to the World Series Endings theme song since I was a kid.  I remember asking my parents for permission to play it before the first game.  My mother grumbled about the appropriateness of our national anthem.  Then I heard it in the World Series and had to get on the team.
Oh no.
Would love that.  Would lead to many good things indeed.  😀👍🇺🇸
Sorry you felt that way.  It’s part of growing up.  People can change.  The theme is appropriate now.
Thanks!  👍😀
Yes it is.  Let’s change that.  👍😀🇺🇸
You know what this campaign is going through.  It’s unacceptable.  We have to do much much better.  👍😀
Not really.  But would love to talk more.  I think our policies would be better suited to this campaign.  My opponent is not quite as extreme as you think.  He even backs the principle of universal health care.  👍🇺🇸
I thought Harvey Weinstein would hide out in Tahiti or someplace forever.  Instead with this in tow comes an historic crisis that is testing many of our institutions and ethics. I will do everything in my power to make this a one-punch punch. We will have a long and winding path ahead. I just turned 70 years old. 👍😀🇺🇸
I remember when union membership rates were at an all-time low.  There was no real union representation.  There were also very few professionals in the profession. Membership was low because there were very few job openings. The next great economic opportunity was going to come from somewhere else.
The Great Patriotic War will be our greatest opportunity to change that.  It will be waged on the home front with food stamps and other handouts. It will be fought on both sides. We can win.  We have the resources.  We just need the political will.
We are in the final day.  Let’s fight for the future.  👍🥊
Thank you 👍🙏
Yes it is.  Great sharing the trail with you.  👍😀
Thanks Megan.  Great sharing the stage with you in Iowa.  👍�
