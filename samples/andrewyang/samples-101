Hey John this is so cool.  👍🙏
Thanks Matt
A few things that have surprised me.  The fact that we may be on the verge of creating some of the most innovative companies in history. The fact that we know who is running the race and that they may not all be the easiest people to like.  We will make the most of it.
Thanks Josh 👍🇺🇸
Not sure they will but we can always go back and change the rules
Thanks David!
I like the idea of a government that is both for the people of the United States as well as for the people of the world.  In other words the people.  I have met people who believe it is a very simple solution.  Let's make it happen.
I’ll be happy to make it happen.  We can make changes much easier and quicker than you’d think.
The press should be doing interviews with people who would be president if they weren’t covering Congress and lobbying.  This way they get to spend their time reporting the news and not getting caught up in lobbying for special interest groups.
A lot of very smart people are not politicians.  We will need more of them in the days and weeks ahead.
I hope to see you soon!
I’m coming to Washington soon!  Hope to be in DC soon!
The truth is the House Republicans are almost guaranteed to lose another federal election despite the incredible support they’re getting from congressional Republicans.  It’s a terrible strategy in an election where the winner generally has a strong mandate. It’s like having the House Majority, but having a Senate campaign that just couldn’t crack 1’.  It’s more of a waste of time.
Thank you David!  Talk to you soon.  Let’s help make it real.
I hate to say it but the @HuffPostUK was definitely in the news yesterday.  That’s awesome.
I find most other candidates are far more likely to hold fundraisers if something significant happens.  I go to a lot of them.
Thanks Steve
The reason some candidates raise lots of cash at events is so they can put it toward a campaign.  But that’s not always the case.  If it’s not enough money it’s not always enough time.
Thanks John!  Hope to meet next time I’m in New Hampshire.
I find the feeling of excitement at these events to be the best.
The news is much the same wherever I go.  I think it’s inevitable that something good will happen - New Hampshire included.  We have a lot of work to do.
Thanks John - we can make a difference!
Thanks Dan!
Will do!
A week from now I’ll be on CNN in New Hampshire talking about my campaign.  I’ll have a blast.  Thank you to everyone who comes to New Hampshire - check it out!  @venture4america has a lot of work to do too. 🙏
Nordic countries have much higher life expectancies than the United States. And I’m guessing that’s part of the problem.  We need to get smarter and build infrastructure to keep people healthy and productive.

Thank you @kimchieman for talking to the campaign. We appreciate it immensely.  Let’s show what we have what it takes to win.  I’m a winner.
In politics you learn that the more you say it takes, the less powerful you get.  We need to get on board.
The American public is sick and tired of Congress not doing something about the problems in their communities.  Too many say “We are the people.” We are going to get smarter.  👍😀🇺🇸
What a time to be alive right now!!  👍
For those of you wondering why my schedule can’t possibly be the best it’ll have something to do with the fact that I’m running for President.  I’m doing everything I can to make 2017 the best yet.  👍🇺🇸🙏
You know what
