The market will tell you that you’re doing nothing but winning.  Make the most of it.
I am not here to raise awareness.  I’m here to do a job.  Let’s go get it.
Wow maybe we can have the Game on out West!  That’ll be fun!  😀👍
I found that having a disability rating on an employer-sponsored health plan was linked to lower disability ratings on an individual basis.
Individuals with a disability rating of 50% or more on an employer-sponsored plan are not allowed to work.
I found that having a disability rating of 50%-59% on an individual basis was linked to higher rates of disability claims.  People with a disability rating of 50%-59% on an individual basis are also more likely to claim FMLA leave.
Games need to have a disability rating too.
These are difficult times for many Americans whose loved ones were victims of gun violence. My wounded feels like any other veteran - the fear and stress of it all.
This shooting in Pittsburgh is a new level of senseless and tragic loss. My heart goes out to the families and communities affected. There’s nothing left to say except we have to make it much harder to get guns in this country, particularly those that can incur mass casualties.
Thanks Phil 👍🇺🇸
I have friends who have put their heart and soul into various causes over the years.  These are people who put their livelihoods on the line for causes they believe in.  I respect their work a great deal.
Most of this is on the Republican side.  Unfortunately Democrats don’t have the votes to enact major reforms to our broken system.  Would be a shame if this were to become a full fledged GOP issue.
Thanks Joe.  😀👍
Finally watching @just_shelter brings back so much goodness.  I can't wait to go back to work.

You know I think the market will stabilize around here sometime in the not-distant future.
Look closer at my résumé and you will see that I have been an entrepreneur for at least 12 years.  That makes me a very unqualified candidate.
People like to argue the wrong things.  Like why does the market have to stabilize?  If it doesn’t then it won’t.
It’s because our economic system is designed to marginalize change.  The market will not care about the dest in the extreme.  And yet it does.
It’s because our political leadership has been paralyzed by symbolic victories and reactive responses.  The status quo is unsustainable.  We need a new approach that will lead to more progress and opportunity.
Thanks Matt.  Appreciate your support a great deal.  Let’s take it all the way.
Sorry you felt that way.  I try to address counterarguments and problems in my book.  Hope I was more successful than you were.
Yes I agree
Great potential
Thank you!
Thank you Elizabeth!  Would love your help making it real!  👍
It’s not real yet.  But soon.
You lead the way
