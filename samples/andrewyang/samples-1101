Good and bad consequences.  Good for progress.  Bad for many people engaged in difficult and often violent laborious tasks.
I get it.  Don’t mean to bring anyone’s race into anything.  Again trying to address the issues that are often tied to socioeconomic status.  👍
Thanks Zach.  👍
“It’s not like there’s a Tomassi candidate.  There’s no Jehmie.  The network doesn’t have a real pro-Clinton bias.  The deck is stacked in favor of Trump.  Enjoyed the debate and think the audience was a good size too.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks!
.@Zach_Graumann suggested a round robin debate format.  1 on 1.  Audience declares a winner.  Could be seeded.  Now that would be must-see TV.
I like the progress gif that Wells put together.  It’s something else.
Looks like I’ll be on @cspan later today - might be my first time.
It’s counterintuitive but when people are getting richer and more powerful it seems like the best time to invest in people. The time is now.
Likely a counterintuitive response but nonetheless.  People seem to lose interest in the stock market after they leave it. It’s like oil went from being the planet’s last vestige to becoming the world’s major issue.
The bottom line is we need to invest much much more in our infrastructure - including upgrading infrastructure to provide a long-term sustainable future. The best shot at solving the long-term problems is to invest in upgrading our infrastructure.
The retraining of the future will be a massive opportunity for many industries. It will create many good jobs and opportunities.  👍
The retraining of the past will be a massive burden on both people and the state. It will require massive public investment. The market will not be supportive of this unless investors are well-prepared.
The market will not be there for traditional manual and cognitive jobs.  There will be new jobs for many of us in the not-too-distant future.
Thanks Dan - means a lot.  👍🇺🇸
The opportunity is right there.  Just need the political will.
I’m coming your way soon 👍🇺🇸
.@PhilipKHoward put it in a way that stuck with me: our political parties are playing “First you fail, then I fail” while our way of life degrades. We need a new set of ideas and a new coalition of voters.

Wow what a turnout!  You all are doing something unprecedented - registering to vote in new and surprising ways.  We will go from strength to strength.  👍😀🇺🇸

This is the real challenge.  Let’s do it.
Thank you.  Spread the word.  👍🇺🇸
We are trying to solve the problems that got Trump elected.  If we scapegoat groups for the problems that got elected we are lost.  Let’s change that.
I’m here to stay.  👍🇺🇸
.@PhilipKHoward and I were friends and classmates.  It’s not unusual for friends to run against each other.  It’s just the latest sign of how much we need each other.
You could argue that the introduction of blockchain has had a ripple effect on the economy.  Businesses that had been hesitant to invest have now started to do so.
Thanks Lee.  Thank you.  👍
Thank you!!  😀👍🇺🇸
I have many friends in Louisiana including @scottsantens - hope all remain safe and dry through Hurricane Barry. These storms are likely to become more and more common and powerful. We should invest in upgrading infrastructure and protecting our communities from climate change.
Way to win it @realDonaldTrump!  😀👍�
