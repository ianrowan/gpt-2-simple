 to get to know people is a great way to find common ground.  👍🇺🇸
Appreciate the lively discussion - appreciate the opportunity to address tens of millions of Americans on our own terms.  👍🇺🇸
Great to hear it!!  😀
This is a very high variance campaign.  Never in American politics have we seen such a low estimate for what we are capable of doing.  It is the opposite of what you’d want in a campaign.
Thank you!!  👍🙏🇺🇸
Great to hear it!!  😀
The current path forward for the underfunded and struggling urban American family is to give them financial security. This would strengthen families and make their jobs more manageable.
This isn’t a new idea.  This is the Ryan Budget that got us to this point.  Hopefully we can move past it and find common ground.
