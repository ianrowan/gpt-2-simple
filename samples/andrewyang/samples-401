care’s tax plan would not only be regressive it likely would fail to raise money from existing beneficiaries and add to budget deficits.
Thanks Nathan - and for the great work you do as well.  👍🇺🇸
Yes we have.  👍
Thanks Nate 👍
Thanks Scott.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Scott.  Don’t mean to attack anyone . Just disagree with the policies.  👍
Thanks Michael — have different perspective on some things that focus on people and people’s ability to pay their bills including healthcare.  Different is not necessarily bad.  And I respect that perspective.
Would enjoy that 👍
Thanks Mike
Thanks Erika 👍
No not yet hope to soon
I like most democrats.  Let’s earn their votes.  👍🇺🇸
For anyone who thinks our system needs to upgrade to make healthcare better and safer is obviously mistaken.  Universal Basic Income is a big deal.  👍
Let’s build the Dream Team
Someone should definitely run against Trump in a general election.  Someone needs to talk about the economy. Someone needs to talk about the problems. Someone needs to talk about the future. Someone else is free to speak for themselves.
My campaign isn’t Trump’s.  It’s Change.  I’m not running for President to push an agenda.  I’m running for VP because I think a VP spot is going to be very fun.  🤨🙏 Would make for some great fireworks.
Not my first rodeo either.  Saw first hand the need to upgrade our infrastructure and our justice system.  We have to do much more and quicker.  👍
Thank you Megan 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Tyler 👍🇺🇸🥊 Thanks Katy👍😎
I would raise the floor for nurses and other health professionals.  The American people would be better off for it and would be better off for it.
Don’t think so.  Rule of law takes precedence over most other considerations.
Thanks Brian 👍
Would make for some amazing fireworks 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Adam 👍
Thanks Ben 👍🇺🇸🥊 Thanks Ben 👍🇺🇸🙏 Appreciate everyone who made this possible and let’s keep improving!  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Eric!  So much for what you’re doing Marco.  So proud of you and the #AmericanPeople.  👍🥊🙏
Would enjoy that James.  👍
Thanks Craig.  You see things clearly.  I respect the work that you do.  Let’s do it.  👍🥊🙏
We can do much more.  We need to do much more.  Let's get it.
Thanks Daniel.  👍🇺🇸
I respect that.  I’m pushing for the best for the United States and its people.  Please take it on board.  🙏  Let’s do it.  👍
If I were President I would get the US to follow through on its promises to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and to impose a tariff on imports from abroad that we would be legally obliged to negotiate under WTO rules.
The irony is that these actions are being taken to address a problem that did not exist in the first place.  It’s absurd and counterproductive.  The solution is to create new problems.
It’s true that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. However, most people did not have access to a job until quite recently. Many of these jobs are very repetitive and require technical or vocational training. Many of these jobs exist only in the shadow of the internet.
The TPP is a terrible trade agreement that would negatively impact workers and communities across the globe. We need to protect consumers and create new jobs wherever possible.
If I suggested that the media should have lobbyists on staff to represent clients I would have no such thing as a 'Lobbyist Effect'.  The media should always be asking questions and trying to figure out the truth.  This is especially true when new technologies are changing so many things we take for granted.
The media should not be trying to suppress information and ideas. Rather it should be trying to explain its current beliefs and values.  The goal should be a deeper humanistic approach to understanding the world.
The proliferation of social media apps has undoubtedly increased competition between firms and lowered prices. However, many consumers still can’t get beyond the initial text message. App preferences and usage guidelines should be transparent and based on actual needs and motivations.
Thanks Adam
