rocking endorsement is no way to win.  Frankly, most Americans just can’t afford it.
Bernie Sanders has inspired millions of people and transformed our politics.  I gave my heart and soul to fighting for a better future. Now more than ever I believe we need to fight for a better future for all of us.
Thanks @cenkuygur @arielhelwani @benfowlkesMMA you rock my book!  Hope to see you in NH!  Congrats on landing in Philadelphia in no time.
I was on @joerogan before he became a politician and rocked the world.  Awesome to think that maybe we can do the same.
I’m glad he’s decided to run for President.  This campaign has had too many breathless years to be true.
Geez the @CNN debates are burning through the clips.  This should be a thing.
The weirdest thing about being a politician in America these days is the inability to make eye contact.
I’d better hit the debates a little harder than that.
I wonder who will play me on @cenkuygur Tonight at 8.  Will be there for sure.
Maybe Bernie will tell the truth when he speaks.  😀
Bernie’s campaign has had a laser focus on specific problems since he announced it in April of 2015.  Now that the heat has died down a little bit, he’s actually starting to touch some pretty substantive issues.
Someone should definitely run against Donald Trump in the Republican primary aside from William Weld. #NeverTrump
With someone with your celebrity status it would help if you weren’t appearing on stage in an attempt to make yourself look better.
Thank you!  😀👍🇺🇸
I’d better get used to it.  😀
You know it.
This Olympics is the most bizarre and wonderful thing I’ve ever seen.  Thank you for being here often.  😀👍🇺🇸
If they couldn’t handle a wounded warrior they cannot.
Also helpful if you are talented and strong like Jones. If you’re talented and weak like most of us you probably can’t do much more than show up and do your job.
Strong men treat women well.
If you go too far one way direction and the other direction.  Sometimes one leads to the other.
Thank you Leslie - you rock!  👍🙏 Appreciate your support a great deal.  👍🇺🇸
Appearing on @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome Monday night with a special announcement - I’m running for President.  Kidding it’s something else.  😀👍 #colbertlateshowtodo
Strong men treat women well.
This Olympics is the most absurd and depressing Olympics I have ever seen.  I’d better watch it again.
Someone must have walked on water for that count.
Thank you Susan.
The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
Thank you 👍
People will be leaders and solve problems if given the opportunity. Leaders’s likeliest to ignore you if you try to tell them something.
Thank you Emma.  That is incredibly sweet.  😀👍
If you think things are going great I may not be your guy.  If you think things are going to be rough I might be just what you’ need.
Thank you Eric 👍🇺🇸
I’m going to miss that show Ray.  Unbelievable.
The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
It’s time to build a Real World Game.
Thanks Jared.  👍😀 Let’s change whatís going on in this country.
If you were to combine the Giants and Jets you might have one real winner.
Which President brings us closer to the finish line?  Let’s find out.
Thank you Sandra - you are a leader and someone we need to thank for your service.  Hope to see you on the trail in Michigan soon!!  👍🇺🇸
Taking a break from the campaign trail I’d like to introduce myself to as many Americans as possible.  Let’s say $1k per per household.  That would be a substantial change from the current state of affairs where the going is tough and the poor are left out in the cold.
Thank you Chelsea!  Coming back soon!!  👍😀🇺🇸
