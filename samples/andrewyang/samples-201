Podcasting has exploded in popularity. People ditch cable all of the time for podcasts. The difference between those that go pro and those that don�t is massive.

I had an usher at a sporting event who was phenomenal. If there was any doubt in my mind he cleared it for me. Thank you.

I have met with over 30 different labor organizations and policy experts during this race. The truth is most people don’t know what they are missing. We are going to make the debates on Fox News, CNN, and on MSNBC the media equivalent of the Grammys.
Thank you 👍
Thanks Jason 👍
People who were on the receiving end of the Trans Pacific Partnership have told me how disappointing it was. The reality is this is a major trade deal. It will give corporations enormous power to shape the terms of our lives. We need policies to keep our economy strong and our communities strong. This is not what people want. We are getting behind the people and we are going to win this thing.
Thanks Eric 👍
Thank you and will be there soon 👍
Thanks Eric 😀😀
Thank you 👍
Thanks Sam 👍😀🇺🇸
One issue for sure is that many workers at the very highest levels of our society are locked in place because they earn their livings with union contracts. You can imagine how that feels. We are one of the only major Western countries which requires our members to be members of the World Union of Workers (WWW) to work for us. This is a terrible way to operate.
Thanks Pat
Thanks Dave 👍
Thank you
Thanks!
The reality is that our policies and procedures for deciding collective bargaining agreements are weak. There is no meaningful public input at any of these levels. This is why we are running for President - to provide the citizens who elected us with the information they deserve.
Thanks Brian 👍
The real question is why are there still so many middle managers who don?t go on strike and who get the lion's share of concessions.
Thanks David 👍
Thanks!
One problem is that our current policies are so counter- productive. There is no reason for middle managers to be involved in the day-to-day running of a company. We need to get a whole lot done. We are going to win this thing for the people.
Thanks!

Thanks for supporting me!  So glad to have the support for this campaign.
As a parent one thing you should know is that when you let your kids take on too much it can be very dangerous. Sometimes teenagers just get in the way.
Thanks Scott
