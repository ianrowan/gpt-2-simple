We should also revive the Office of Technology Assessment so that Congress has its own set of technical experts to turn to for guidance. We are decades behind on these issues and they threaten to undermine our democracy, depress our children and transform our way of life.
The FTC settlement with Facebook is the latest sign that we need a new Department of the Attention Economy to focus solely on regulating the digital economy. I would also appoint a Secretary of Technology in the Cabinet to address tech issues before they become full-blown crises.
Thank you @DMRegister - enjoyed the convo a great deal and appreciate the work you do each day.  👍🙏
Thanks Rutger - took that from your TED talk.  Was there.  👍 Thank you for opening so many hearts and minds.  🙏😀
It would also make car repairs an irritation rather than a catastrophe, give parents more time with their children, spur arts, creativity and entrepreneurship, and have myriad other positive effects on our way of life.
Studies have shown that not being able to pay your bills consumes bandwidth and reduces functional IQ by 13 points - almost one standard deviation. The #FreedomDividend would make us more rational, reasonable, optimistic, generous and more able to solve problems.
What is making things worse in America is a mindset of scarcity - if someone else is doing well then I’m somehow losing out. The antidote is a mindset of abundance - if you are doing well that’s great for me too. The question is how to generate an abundance mindset in more of us.
Great meeting you too!  😀👍🙏
Thank you!  😀👍 This is very clever.
Thank you!!  😀🙏
Thank you for being there!!  😀👍
You all have a beautiful family 😀👍
Thank you!!  😀👍
Always loved Andrew Lloyd Webber.  My parents took me to see Phantom of the Opera as a kid and it made quite an impression.
I think some of the big tech companies should be forced to divest parts of their businesses. But we need to home in on the specific problems we are trying to solve. Sometimes that would involve breaking up parts of a business sometimes it would involve a different approach.
Thank you @karaswisher for the awesome convo 👍
Thanks to everyone who made it happen!  YangGang is the best 🥊🙏👍
You know it Ryan 😀👍
It’s quite hot here in Iowa.  Good thing I wear a jacket and trousers.
Climate change is much too benign sounding - we need to rebrand it to “climate crisis” or “global warming” or “climate catastrophe” to convey the severity of the situation we are in.
AI joke: “How far behind the US is China in AI research?”  Answer: “12 hours.”  Now they might be ahead not behind.
Thank you Kara - great spending time with you!  😀👍
I love it!  😀👍
If I was there would be constant shots of my face being like “I will let you two hash this out.”
Glad I’m not standing in-between Joe and Kamala.
America is fantastic at letting market incentives dominate - but our current problems aren’t market-based problems. There is no market-based solution to fighting climate change or reintegrating society - unless we create them and change the rules.
Here is something you never hear when a company pays a dividend: “What are the shareholders going to do with the money?” “How do we know they’ll do something good with it?” We are the owners and shareholders of this society. A #FreedomDividend would improve our lives each day.
Thanks @embot 👍
On the way to Des Moines for some campaigning - see you soon Iowa!
Watching Trump continue to try to bully people for political mileage is disgusting.  I can’t wait to relegate him to the dustbin of history.
Coincidentally heading to Iowa tomorrow.  👍
Freaking global warming.
Just heard that we are rescheduling the Philly rally due to a heat wave that is advising people to stay someplace cool.  #HumanityFirst and safety first. Will reschedule and be there soon!!  😀🙏
Thanks @jenn_elias 👍🇺🇸
They didn’t see us coming. They will doubt us at every turn. And when we win they will be left wondering how it happened.
Thank you!!
Thank you!!  😀👍🇺🇸
I have met with several veteran groups and one vet told me something profound. “It’s not that employers just aren’t pro-veteran. They are actually looking for reasons to say no and rule you out because they think you’re damaged goods.”  We need to do much more for our veterans.
One thing I’ve discovered through this campaign - there are many people who see things the same way that I do. It’s just that none of us has been in position to run for President.
Thanks Steve!  @khrystinausa
Thank you!!
That’s a great T-shirt!  😀👍
Thank you!!  👍🇺🇸🙏
There are times when new technology seems a bit like magic. We need to take the good aspects and amplify them while acknowledging that there are going to be many unintended consequences that we need to own and address too.
Thank you @alexisohanian for being such an awesome role model - it’s Dads like you who will help make paid family leave a reality in the US.  👍🇺🇸
Running for President is both less human and more human than you’d think. Less human because you spend a lot of time chasing media coverage and $$. More human because you have awesome supporters with incredible stories all over the country.  👍😀 #YangGang
As the son of immigrants I’ve been told to go back where I came from several times. When I was young it hurt. Now it seems absurd. We are all American.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Caleb great to meet you!  😀👍
Thank you for being here!  😀👍🇺🇸
Characterizing members of Congress as being from another country is part of the problem. We need to come together and stop putting up false barriers between different groups of people.
I’ve been through a blackout in NYC. It can be very frightening and dangerous. It’s just the latest sign of how much we need to invest in our infrastructure - not just for efficiency and sustainability but for our basic health and safety.
About 25% of Americans are considered politically disengaged.  If we activate enough of them we can win the whole election.
Thank you!!  😀👍
Thanks @PDXYangGang 👍🥊
I have many friends in Louisiana including @scottsantens - hope all remain safe and dry through Hurricane Barry. These storms are likely to become more and more common and powerful. We should invest in upgrading infrastructure and protecting our communities from climate change.
Way to win it @LeslieSmith_GF!  😀👍🥊
I find live action remakes of Aladdin, Lion King and other movies I grew up with a bit depressing. It’s like we can’t come up with new stories.
Thanks Dalton!
The longer this campaign goes the shorter my hair gets.
Thanks @AriMelber enjoyed the convo a great deal.  👍😀🇺🇸
Another detail - only 12% of respondents feel confident they know who they will support.  This race is very early.  😀👍
Financial insecurity has the effect of decreasing mental bandwidth - studies have shown that it reduces functional IQ by 13 points. Getting the economic existential stress off our minds would actually make us smarter, more rational and optimistic.
Yes I did!!  🙏😀👍
Thank you and will be back in NH soon!!  👍😀
Also not a great sign that Washington DC is now the richest metro area in the country.
Someone just comped me my fast casual dinner and said “#YangGang!” That’s a great feeling.
Thank you!
Thank her for me too!  😀👍
I’m very fortunate. Let’s give more people a chance to say the same.
People with dyslexia often make great entrepreneurs. Their struggles in school often drive them toward different approaches to solving problems and making connections.  Our neurodiversity should be celebrated not discouraged.
Thank you Alyssa!  😀👍
I sometimes imagine this race without us in it - and it makes me glad to be running.
Makes me happy too!  😀👍
If we mistake money for the worth of a person we are lost.
I say I ride my bicycle to work because it’s faster and better exercise - but the truth is it’s a lot more fun. 😀
Just met with a robotocist- he described how 96% of a warehouse fulfillment job has been automated leaving humans to do the remaining mind-numbing 4%. They often quit.  “If that’s the future of work we need a different one.”
This just in - I’m in this for the long haul.  I don’t have another position to run for.  This is the only one.  😀👍
Thanks Erick
One thing that @WhoopiGoldberg @sunny @JoyVBehar stressed to me during the break - the economic numbers don’t match up to how people are doing. We need to use measurements like health, life expectancy, mental health, childhood success and environment quality as measures instead.
Congrats to the #USWNT on the victory and World Cup title!!  One of the feelgood stories of the summer.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thomas Paine the author of “Common Sense” was for it.  😀👍🇺🇸
Universal Basic Income seems like a radical idea until you realize that our winner-take-all economy is about to accelerate in unprecedented ways.  There are very few means to distribute the gains broadly and quickly to millions of Americans. It becomes common sense very quickly.
I still feel like a pretty normal person. May that be a good thing.
If we play their game we lose. If we play our game we have a chance to win.
Wow PG trade out of nowhere. Two superteams in LA.  Didn’t see that coming.
Thanks Morgan 👍😀
You guys are amazing!
Thank you Tim!
I’m somewhat difficult to offend.  I think that’s a good thing.
Someone just yelled out the side of their car at me “Let’s make it happen!” I like his attitude.  👍😀
If WeWork gets valued as a tech company so should UPS.
And my kicking a bottle cap is now one of our best-performing videos ever. Maybe next time I’ll break a board with my head.
Thank you for believing in the Freedom Dividend!  It looks like we will choose the winner right after the holiday - and then it will take a little bit to contact and vet the winner and match them up to the Twitter account.  Excited to see who wins!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks 👍
#BottleCapChallenge
Someone said that supporting my campaign is the most fun they’ve had in ages.  That made me very happy.
Also expensive.
The military is one of the most trusted institutions in American life. Politicizing it for a holiday celebration is a terrible precedent.
Thanks Nara. It’s folks like you who will transform what people think over time. Each person is capable of more than what is expected of us. I for one am not going anywhere. Congrats on your passion and activism - I know you are only getting started.  👍🥊🇺🇸
That’s the plan Barry. What’s interesting is that aside from Harris there hasn’t been much of a bump from the debates for other candidates. So the more we do up front the better.  👍
Love this thanks Phyllis!!  🙏
Yes we have to reach the landline answering generation. Think about the folks you know who answer the phone and talk to pollsters. Or maybe they can pick up the phone just this once.  😀👍
Looks like Nevada is one of the early states that counts too.  👍😀
I will update this thread anytime we get an approved poll result and then we will celebrate the 4th one together.  😀👍🇺🇸
If there’s a key thing to do it’s to reach out to folks who get polled - particularly in the early states - and tell them to come out for Yang! Literally a few dozen poll responses could make a difference. Let’s do it.  👍😀
We’ve made 2%+ in some of the polls that count before (Fox, Monmouth) so we are in great position to meet this. Polls in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina count too.
Thanks @marchandsteve @khrystinausa 👍🇺🇸
Heading on @TheView next Monday and already looking forward to it!  Maybe we can talk about something different like how I like cheesy rom-coms.
The weirdest thing is the Knicks just overpaid role players instead of taking on other contracts for draft picks. It’s like they didn’t even watch what the Nets just did.
Having kids is its own education.
Thanks @cenkuygur @TYTPolitics 👍🇺🇸
I hope @MrAndyNgo is okay. Journalists should be safe to report on a protest without being targeted.
Thank you for sharing your time and home with me - meant a ton.  👍🙏
Though June is ending #pride 🏳️‍🌈 is just beginning. Love is love. Embracing our shared humanity has no limits.
The weirdest thing is when someone you grew up watching on TV follows you. Your natural reaction is like “Oh snap @DWilkins21 dunk contest ‘88!”  We are all human.
At least the Knicks traded their franchise player for cap space.
Wow Kyrie and KD to the Nets!  That’s unbelievable. They earned it by building the right way.  What a turnaround story.  Barclays will be the place to be in NYC come the Fall.  👍
Wow a lot of interest! Fantastic. Let us know who you think would be a good guest in replies below and we’ll try to get them. 😀👍
Anything that improves the political climate on the Korean peninsula and engages North Korea on its nuclear program is a good thing.
Thank you!!  You and the boys were early.  😀👍
Let me say how irritating it is that rules are keeping citizens from giving other citizens money in a way that helps this campaign even peripherally.  But rules are rules and I obviously agree with contribution limits.
Now we are trying to figure out how to channel the generosity of those who have the means and have been inspired by the campaign to help others. Option 1 is to say “Do it yourself in your own way with zero connection to our campaign because we don’t want you to get in trouble.”
This doesn’t apply to the candidate himself. So if I do it it’s fine, though it’s considered a contribution to my campaign.
A supporter tonight suggested I start doing a podcast called “Let Yang Speak” and do an annotated commentary on the debate and other topics. Like this if you like the idea.  😀👍
Demian Maia’s nickname should be the Blanket of Sorrow.
Thanks Albert
We have to make being human a good thing.
Heading to an event - the theme is “No Ties.”  I kind of like the sound of that.
My guesses:  Kawhi to Lakers, KD and Klay re-sign with Warriors, Kyrie and Harris to Nets, Kemba to Celtics, Butler to Clips, DLo to Phoenix, Knicks get Randle and Rozier.
This race may be humans vs. machines in more ways than one.
The past couple days have been a wonderful reminder of how many people have invested their hopes for the future in this campaign.  Thank you.  We can do it.  You all are uplifting.
Running for President definitely makes the world seem like more of a simulation.
Wearing makeup makes me feel like Brent Spiner in Star Trek: TNG.
The erosion in trust in institutions is a problem for Dems in particular - if people don’t trust institutions they also mistrust institution-based solutions.
Yes USA Women’s National Team - way to beat France!  U-S-A!  👍🇺🇸 #USWMNT
I was the last kid who would have run for student body President. Probably a good thing.
I’ve noticed that conservatives often follow liberals on Twitter - but the reverse does not seem to be true.
I’d better hit the gym if that’s my future travel mode.
Haha #LetYangSpeak indeed.  You all are the best.  The #YangGang is amazing. 👍😀
I stood at the center of the political universe last night and did not come away encouraged by our future. Will do my best to change that.  👍🇺🇸
With someone with your considerable public profile it would be helpful if you display a sense of openness to the possibilities instead of simply a cut and dried conclusion. There is data in both directions.  Our society depends on our getting this right.  👍
Overall I’m pumped for what we accomplished and even more pumped to take what I’ve learned and get out there again soon. 😀👍🇺🇸
Like you have to fake and force things even more than I’d anticipated. I’m a quick study though.  😀
Fourth, I’m glad that the network switches and we get different moderators each time.
Third, this format is not a natural one for me at all.  Requires very specific behaviors that feel very forced.
Second, I feel bad for those who tuned in to see and support me that I didn’t get more airtime. Will do better (my mic being off unless called on didn’t help) and glad to have another opportunity in July (and afterwards)!
Some reflections from my first debate:  First very glad to have the chance to represent on stage!  Truly a privilege and thank you for making it happen.
I love this campaign. If it were a straight line it wouldn’t be human. These are big changes we are fighting for. Appreciate the chance to speak to the American people - we have come a long way in a short time. We have much longer still to go.
I never thought as a kid I’d be anywhere near here.  But now that I’m here it feels right.  Let’s do it.
I’m glad I don’t feel pressure to manufacture some ‘breakout’ moment as we are in great position to make the debates through the Fall.  😀👍
I wonder who will play me on SNL.
Looks like I can forget about reading that briefing book on Yemen.
9 million viewers tonight - going to be more tomorrow.  👍😀🇺🇸
Well that was fun.  It will be highly interesting to see what impact this has on various candidates’ momentum. I wonder if voter impressions have formed or changed.
This debate both flew by and was 2 hours long.
Ooh I just saw an ad for the 2nd debates in July in Detroit!  Looking forward to that too.  Maybe I’ll get next to Joe Biden next time.
Lester Holt has a deep and resonant voice.
Inside scoop - you get an option as a candidate to have a little stage to stand on for the #DemDebate to make you look taller.
Sorry Ms. Trovato my 9th grade Spanish teacher - not your fault.  🙏
Oh no - technical difficulties.  It’s the Russians.
FYI - most candidates know each other and are friendly behind the scenes. Makes it rare to take swings.
The trickiest thing will be keeping my facial expression neutral while the person next to me is talking and I’m on camera.
My Spanish is terrible.
This debate is very interesting.
Translation:  we are going to be in this race the whole freaking time.  😀
Thanks Gilad - those were great times.  😀👍 #YangGang
Money doesn’t make people lazy.  Sometimes it has the opposite effect.
Landed in Miami and I am ready to speak words.
Shocker - people like money.  Modifying our capital flows to get more money into the hands of people and families is the most powerful positive thing we could for our society.
Someone this weekend thanked me for running.  I told them “Thank my wife.”
Inside joke as @scottsantens is the guru of Universal Basic Income.  If you want to learn more about it he is the guy to follow.  👍
The winner of the Freedom Dividend - @scottsantens of New Orleans, Louisiana!  Haha just kidding.  😀
Betting that things will stay the same is going to be a tougher and tougher bet to win.
Thank you - can’t wait to see who wins on July 4th!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Bernie’s plan to wipe out student loan debt paid for by a financial transactions tax is very much a plan in the right direction.
Thanks Russell - enjoyed spending time with you.  😀👍🇺🇸
Haha thank you!!  😀👍🙏🏳️‍🌈
Mature companies often declare dividends for their shareholders. Mature societies will start to do the same.
Looking good!  Thank you!  👍😀
He’s cute!!  😀👍
Fantastic!!  👍🇺🇸😀
Appearing on @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome Monday night with a special announcement - I’m running for President!  Kidding it’s something else.  😀👍
Someone told me that folks in DC are stunned by our campaign’s success - that we are outperforming senators who have been preparing for a presidential run for years. To that I say: they haven’t seen anything yet.
Zephaniah is one cute kid!  😀👍
An old Economics joke that I like:    Q: “How would an economist stuck on a desert island open a can of beans?”  A: “He would assume he had a can opener.”
The Nets have leadership, culture, personnel and a plan. The Knicks have hopes.
Talking to a doctor who practices telemedicine - he is licensed in 8 states but if he talks to someone in another state he’s not allowed to help them. That seems woefully inefficient.
In South Carolina with the other presidential candidates.  One element of running for President is you get feedback based on how people react to you.  Based on people’s reactions we are growing fast with more to come.  👍 A lot of #YangGang in SC!
See you in Miami Marianne!  😀👍🙏
On my way see you soon!
Thank you Steven 👍🇺🇸
A neighbor just came up to me and said “Return of the Mack” and gave me a thumbs up.
If you think we need tweaks and a return to normalcy I may not be your candidate.  If you think we need to rewrite the rules of the economy to work for people in the 21st century then I may be just who you’re looking for.
Holy cow Zion and his Mom are making me emotional.
Hear other guests include Spider-Man himself @TomHolland1996 👍😀
Will be on @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome on Monday night June 24 and couldn’t be more excited.  Going to be a huge week!  😀👍🇺🇸 #YangGang
Glad to hear @cavsdan out of the hospital and on the mend! Has done a tremendous amount for Michigan and Ohio in particular. Get well soon Dan!
In particular everyone will know I won campaigning on a dividend for the American people. When people realize we can build an economy that works for us the momentum will be impossible to contain.
Sometimes people ask me how we will make all of these changes when I am President. Their question presupposes that I win. And after I win all things become possible. 👍🇺🇸
Pretending we can round up 12 million plus undocumented immigrants is a nonstarter - it would collapse regional economies, separate families and is essentially an impossibility. We need to provide a long-term path to citizenship and start addressing the issues in an honest way.
I’m getting stronger all the time.
Me at a campaign event: “Hello I’m Andrew.”    Supporter: “I know who you are.”    Me: “Yeah sorry. I only know one way to introduce myself.”
One thing we should do pronto - wire rural areas with broadband. With some federal incentives we can get it up to 99.8% without undue difficulty and expense.
Anyone running for President ought to be passionate about upgrading our infrastructure - you travel the country so much you can’t help but use it all. Planes trains highways Internet you name it. And you are constantly trying to get stuff done.
KAG really doesn’t have the same ring as MAGA in my opinion.
Thank you!!
When I’m President the plan is to be too busy solving problems to be having rallies for my re-election.
When I see a MATH hat in the wild it puts a smile on my face and I want to run and high-five the wearer.  Let’s Make America Think Harder.  😀👍🇺🇸
Haha thank you!  😀👍
Thanks Ari.  👍🇺🇸
“I love having a solid entrepreneur in the mix.”  Thanks for that.  😀👍
I had a TV appearance this morning. On the way out the person asked, “do you want to wipe your makeup off?” I said, “No thanks I have another appearance today.” That is running for President.
Every once in a while a Bird scooter feels like the greatest invention in the world.
Every campaign has dozens - or hundreds or thousands - of individuals who have dropped everything and changed their lives to do something they believe in.  Thank you.  🙏👍🇺🇸
The new Facebook-backed cryptocurrency Libra could be a big step for the hundreds of millions of unbanked around the world. It’s use of the blockchain makes a lot of sense. Could even curb corruption as a lot of int’l aid money intended for impoverished people never reaches them.
Thank you Hailey 👍🙏
The speaker before me - Joe Biden 😀👍
If we don’t have one by the time I take office I will make a National 5G rollout plan a top priority as President.
This will also demand that the US devise a more concerted national plan for rolling out 5G. Hopefully this is forthcoming.
Interdependence decreases the likelihood of conflict. After you force Chinese companies to adjust and adapt you have a more limited toolkit in terms of carrots and sticks.
The US - China tech trade war will have profound implications. It will be a massive setback for Chinese providers like Huawei in the short term. But if they succeed in building software independent of Google they will have a very different ecosystem. I preferred interdependence.
Thanks Chris 👍🇺🇸
I’d retain all public assistance programs Ben.  But appreciate a genuine discussion.  👍
I like that abundance mindset.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Sam!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Brandon - means a lot.  😀🙏🇺🇸
Thanks Chris - would love that.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you so much for the Father’s Day wishes!  You all are the best.  🙏😎
Thanks Brian - enjoyed the interview a great deal.  👍🇺🇸
The protests in Hong Kong are historic - I admire their courage and self-determination a great deal.  Hope it leads in the right direction and demonstrates what people can do to effect positive change. 👍🙏
Thank you
As for my chances of contending for the White House - the money has me at #6 and rising fast. You may want to wait until our democracy speaks before you rate my - or any - candidate’s chances.
Media figures like you should do more than cite a stat - come with me to Michigan or Ohio or Western PA and explain to the workers how their jobs haven’t been automated away because your chart says otherwise.
The low productivity stats can be partially explained by the fact that everyone has to try to find a job in order to make ends meet. Many are doing low productivity jobs to survive. These stats are also backwards looking and ignore all that is on the horizon.
Thanks Paul.  As you know there is plenty of evidence to support the automaton thesis. Labor force participation is stubbornly low at 63% the same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica with almost 1 out of 5 prime working age men out of the workforce.
11:25 👍
We will win not because of wealth or fame or political clout - but because of the power of our ideas and our vision for the country.
LeBron, AD and the Lakers in a wide- open West will be fun.
Congrats Eugene!  😀👍👏
I’d think you would be for the eradication of poverty Stephanie?  I admire your work and have the best intentions.  Happy to meet anytime.  Thank you!  👍🇺🇸
I’m going to humanize the Presidency.
It’s hard to solve a problem if you don’t identify it or know what it is.
Thank you 👍🇺🇸
Thank you
Definitely our dreams 👍
Thanks Pat - congrats on the beautiful family.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you Marcellus - you are the best.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thank you!!
Thank you Sam!  🙏🇺🇸
Hope so Matilda!  👍😀🇺🇸
I’m an operator.  I figure out the key variables for success in an endeavor and then I optimize for those.  You could say I’m good at tests.
I want to express how fairly we have been treated by the @DNC every step of the way.  Truly democracy in action.  👍🇺🇸
When a company declares a dividend for shareholders we think it’s great management. When the US declares a dividend for all of us we will think it’s great too.  👍🇺🇸
Congrats to the Raptors - some happy people up North tonight!  Enjoy it.  👍🇨🇦
I had Toronto in 7 - but I think they close it out tonight.
Hey Derek - I think you have misrepresented my point of view. Agree that for-profit schools are among the biggest abusers and problematic actors - several of my policies are geared in that direction. Also agree that college is by and large a good thing. 👍
Thanks Cenk - much appreciated 👍🇺🇸🥊
Love it Charles 👍🇺🇸 Couldn’t agree more
On the road to New Hampshire - see you soon!!  👍😀🇺🇸
Most political polls are done by calling people with landlines. I have the feeling that this may underestimate our support.  😀 Still we have to reach people where they are.  We have a lot of work to do.  👍
You know what’s expensive?  Disintegration and climate catastrophe. Inaction is expensive at this point.
Thank you Caroline 😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Howard 👍
Thanks William 👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  👍🇺🇸😀
Thank you Alex.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Krystal - learned from you 👍
Thank you Greg 👍
Out of 19 presidential candidates in Iowa this weekend I guarantee you that several were missing family obligations.  That’s what happens when you run for President.  If a front runner says that we have different values that’s on him.
So excited for this - thank you Kyle and Pam for letting me help!!  👍🙏🇺🇸
People on the Internet generally exist in real life too.
That KD injury is the worst.  He must have known he wasn’t right but he tried to be there for his team in the end.  Showed a lot of character and heart.  🙏👏👍
Sent in the materials to the DNC certifying our qualification for the June and July debates. It’s on.  😀👍🇺🇸 #YangGang
Looks like the celebration is on hold. Gutty win by the Warriors.
I foresee a big celebration in Toronto tonight.
Thank you!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you for your service!  Always learning from those doing the work.  👍🇺🇸🙏
This campaign cycle is an historic opportunity.  Let’s make the most of it.  👍🇺🇸🥊
#1 in a ranking finally!  😀👍
Thank you Maureen 👍🇺🇸
Thank you Crystal!!  😀👍
.@MileyCyrus is underrated.
Democrats tend to have a culture of collegiality - a good thing in most respects. In a presidential election though it has its benefits and drawbacks.
Thanks Dave!  👍
Seriously watch this video - it will make you very proud to be #YangGang
It’s true - getting money into families’ hands would improve education.
Thanks Nick for leading the way on this.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks @maureenoco great sharing the road with you 😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Erick 👍
Being happy for the flourishing of others is a sign of abundance. Being upset about it is a symptom of scarcity. We need to push everyone towards abundance as fast as possible.
A journalist asked me if I ‘picked’ Universal Basic Income because I thought it would be a good presidential platform.  I told him “You have it in reverse. I’m running for President to make Universal Basic Income a reality, not the other way around.”
Thank you Erica!!  👍🥊🇺🇸
Thank you!!  😀👍👏
I think that every four years there should be at least one presidential candidate who comes from outside the government.  It seems positive to have different points-of-view.
Just left the Iowa Hall of Fame dinner - we can definitely contend.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Good thing I have a last name that rhymes with Gang.
Thank you Barbara 👍🇺🇸🙏
On my way to speak at the Iowa Democratic Hall of Fame event - 19 presidential candidates speaking today.  It’s like a convention.  Thank you #YangGang for making this possible.
I believe we can get more done for different kinds of people by emphasizing what we share in common rather than what distinguishes us from each other.
Thank you Tiffany 👍🙏🇺🇸
Thank you Sebastian - means a lot.  👍🇺🇸
Silicon Valley parents are among the most likely to say that their kids get zero screen time.  That tells you all you really need to know.
As President I would create a Department of the Attention Economy to get into the guts of social media apps and counterbalance their financial incentives with the mental health of our kids. We can design these apps to be healthier and less addictive.
Parents are outgunned. It’s impossible to compete or insulate your kid from screens entirely. As a friend in tech said: “We have our smartest engineers turning supercomputers into slot machines and dopamine-delivery devices for teenagers.”
I also can’t imagine being a parent and having your daughter go through that. You would feel so helpless.
When I had a hard time at school as a kid I could go home and close the door.  Today your peers are right there with you in your room through your phone.  I can’t imagine going through that as an eleven-year-old.
Just spoke to a parent who said that his 11-year old daughter has been struggling with suicidal thoughts in part because of bullying over social media. I know that his daughter is not the only young person experiencing this kind of struggle.
Identity politics often goes well beyond that I think.
All for acknowledging and affirming identities.  👍
Hope so!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  👍
I understand the impulse, but identity politics are a great way to lose elections. We need to bring people together.
We may have to innovate our way out of this mess.  That includes politically.
You know what was awesome?  Seeing MATH hats in the audience.  Way to go #YangGang!  😀👍
We have shifted gears and are looking at doing something a bit more intimate in Miami that time depending on whether I’m debating the 26th or 27th. Thank you for bearing with us!  👍
Enjoyed the heck out of @billmaher @RealTimers - this set is a fun one. Overtime in a few mins.  👍
Thanks Dave - enjoyed the convo a great deal.  👍🇺🇸
I studied Economics in college - which still was not the same as financial literacy.
Communities should get reports on their wellness, education and economic progress the same way they currently do on sports scores.
I guarantee I’m not the first candidate with autism in the family.  It’s unfortunate that most don’t talk about it.
Revolutions are like recessions - everyone knows they happen periodically but no one sees one coming.
Thanks Rachel
If a fan shoves an NBA player during a game he probably shouldn’t be allowed to attend any more NBA games.
And we will do an Andrew Yang dance in perfect unison.
Thanks Peter - means a lot.  We need more philosophy in the White House.
You know what I find really odd - the transitive property of points of view.  That is if I talk to someone I must believe everything they believe. That seems ridiculous to me. Of course people will believe different things.
The illusions are failing. We are in an era of unpleasant truths. The question is what we do with them.
Looking forward to this 👍
And for those who are wondering the answer is Randy Savage.
Running for President is one part startup, one part playwright, one part media company, and one part pro wrestling.
Met another Andrew Yang last night.  One day all of us will get together.
The best balance would be term limits that are quite long - say 18 years - that would be long enough for expertise and coalitions to be built up without letting legislators become totally careerist and self-dealing.
The drawback to term limits is that they would entrench the non-legislative bureaucracy and may make it harder for legislators to organize as everyone keeps showing up new with a learning curve and a need to form relationships and coalitions.
Term limits in DC are a good idea - they would lead legislators to try and get something done and then go home. They would also make room for new leaders. We all know some folks have been in DC for a very long time.
Thanks Chris - the #YangGang is just getting started.  😀👍
Someone thanked me for running for office last night. I told them they should thank my wife.
Spoke to a tech CEO last week who told me “AI is going to replace a lot of basic coding jobs. We don’t talk about that much but it’s happening.”
I fly coach. It makes for some interesting conversations sometimes.  😀
Yes I do watch Black Mirror.
America needs a comprehensive 5G rollout strategy. It’s vital to our present and future competitiveness.
Thrilled the House has passed the American Dream and Promise Act — now for the Senate to make it law.  👍🇺🇸 #DreamAndPromiseNow
People won’t agree with me on everything - but I think they will respect my approach and know that I’m approaching problems with an eye toward what the data says as well as the experience on the ground. I don’t care whose idea it is if it solves the problem.
The tariffs on imports from Mexico will hit American consumers, cost tens of thousands of American jobs and are a bizarre way to stem the flow of migrants - if their economy takes a hit more people will want to move for new opportunities. It’s a big move in the wrong direction.
When I started this campaign I figured I’d vote for someone like me.  I couldn’t be the only one.  😀
Money doesn’t solve every problem - but it sure helps with a lot of them.
Thanks @TalibVisram 👍
Someone should definitely run against Trump in the Republican primary aside from William Weld. @mcuban? Higher upside than most think.
If I thought things were going to be all right I definitely would not have run for President.
I wear makeup so often now I often forget that it’s on.
If you think our institutions are going to rescue us you have not been paying close attention.
Thank you @jack for the support - look forward to fighting for the future alongside you.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Heading on @RealTimers on @HBO with @billmaher this Friday - looking forward to it.  👍
Thanks Steven
Yikes - Toronto kind of needed that game.
I’m actually kidding - I think there’s tons of middle ground. 😀👍🇺🇸
In America the overreaction is sometimes worse than the problem.
Trying to suppress ideas often doesn’t truly make them disappear - it just pushes them into the shadows where they sometimes gain strength and currency. Being open to ideas is itself a sign of confidence in your own.
If the #YangGang were a wrestling promotion we would definitely be @AEWrestling
One would think that the eradication of poverty in the US would be very very popular. It will be soon. We have the resources. We just need the political will. That’s what this campaign will provide.  👍🇺🇸
When I’m President the last thing anyone will be concerned about is the name on a boat.  We have much bigger things to focus on.
According to twins studies between one-third and one-half of political alignment is linked to genetics; that is most of us are born somewhat wired to be liberal or conservative. If this is the case we need to build bridges as much as possible. It’s not just info or culture.
Someone said that the media we consume is analogous to the food we eat.  If that’s the case Twitter is definitely candy.
Reading the Righteous Mind by @JonHaidt - apparently there is something magical about dancing to bring people together. We should make our rallies into dance parties if possible.  😀
P.S. President Mike Pence
Personally I think the focus should be on solving the problems that got Trump elected in the first place. Democrats should focus on winning and improving people’s lives. If the political landscape changes then one can reevaluate.
The desire to impeach Trump is understandable - but the fact is impeachment is almost certain to fail in the GOP Senate which would require 67 senators to approve. Unless a bunch of GOP Senators decide to get on board it will fail, rally the GOP base and play into Trump’s hands.
Is it possible that a disgruntled employee would respond less violently if he was going home to a secure financial future? I’d say that is very possible and even likely over a large number of cases. Stress kills and financial stress kills. Universal Basic Income would save lives.
As President I would attack this problem from all angles. Mental health. Gun buybacks. Background checks. Free upgrades to signature guns. And a push to bring law-abiding gun owners to the table to say enough is enough and we can do more to protect ourselves from gun violence.
The vast majority of Americans agree on common sense gun regulations.  We can move forward. We must move forward. The alternative is to become a country numb to periodic mass shootings. We must be better than that. We owe it to ourselves and our children.
The shooting in Virginia Beach is a nightmare come to life - a disgruntled employee who massacred innocents. My heart goes out to the families and individuals who were killed and injured. We have to make it harder for people to get and use guns that can cause such tragedies.
As someone running for President I respect and appreciate how much each candidate puts into it. It requires an extraordinary level of commitment. Commentators who miss this are missing just how much work goes into each campaign, even one that doesn’t reach its goals.
Wow just found out my book the War on Normal People is getting translated into at least 3 other languages. #HumanityFirst
I find my mind works better when I read a lot.
Meant ‘previous generations’ 😀👍
One thing I’ve noticed about many politicians - they are unlikely to do something they perceive as against their own interests. If this changes all things become possible.
.@PhilipKHoward put it in a way that stuck with me: our political parties are playing “First you fail, then I fail” while our way of life degrades. We need a new set of ideas and a new coalition of voters.
Wow maybe we can have the Game on out West!  That’ll be fun!  😀
The Raptors had to win Game 1.  You could argue they need to win Game 2 as well with Durant out.
“You’re the first political candidate I’ve ever donated to.”  Love hearing that.
I haven’t been this hyped for a basketball game in quite some time.
This is controversial - I would even accept a pay raise for legislators if it helps lead to a ban on lobbying after the fact. A very small price to pay for a cleaner more effective legislature.  👍🇺🇸
This bill would fundamentally change the revolving door incentives on Capitol Hill.  Would be absolutely gamechanging and would dramatically improve legislation over time. Government would look out for people more and big business less.
It will be amazing seeing the rationale for rejecting this bill.  “Members of Congress are needed to represent industry after they leave office so big business will understand government.”  Please.
Thanks Daryl 👍🇺🇸
I for one applaud and appreciate the openness and transparency that the @DNC has had in its qualifications for the debates. Grassroots fundraising support and polling are both objective measurements. Truly democracy in action.  👍🇺🇸
.@Zach_Graumann suggested a round robin debate format.  1 on 1.  Audience declares a winner.  Could be seeded.  Now that would be must-see TV.
I have a confession - I harbor hope that @JLin7 comes in and makes a huge difference in the Finals.  😀👍
This campaign is going to win because we have the sharpest sense of the problems, the clearest and most effective solutions, and the most positive and achievable vision for the future of the country.
The truth is that we have earned coverage through grassroots support.  Thank you.  🇺🇸👍🙏
When we were getting very little mainstream news coverage we were like “it doesn’t matter, people get their news in other ways.” Now that we are getting picked up in the press we have changed our tune to “these journalists are amazing!” 😀
It’s true - grassroots fundraising is the lifeblood of this campaign. Thank you.
Yes it would!  They work hard enough and their own kids miss them.  👍
Thank you Angela!  😀👍
Enjoyed the convo a great deal Preet 👍
Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rand Paul so many folks you kind of forget were there and in the running.  Reminds you of the fluidity of these elections.
Talking to a military vet - he recommends that veterans be able to get medical treatment at any hospital and have the VA pay the bill at cost.  Says that the VA doesn’t have a lot of services for women either.  Makes sense to me.  Faster services for vets at the same cost.
On a separate note I would independently strengthen Social Security so that it stays strong for future generations. A straightforward way to accomplish this is to lift the wage cap on contributions to Social Security.
I for one have no desire to live in a country where older Americans are destitute and doing subsistence jobs until the day they die. What good is unprecedented prosperity if our parents and loved ones cannot retire with dignity.
This will help address the pending retirement crisis as well as channel much needed resources to elder care and assistance.  It will create many new jobs and opportunities.
The Freedom Dividend is intended as a supplement to Social Security.  Social Security is a forced annuity - the Freedom Dividend is on top of it.  There is no reason for elderly Americans to be struggling with day-to-day expenses in the richest country on earth.  👍🇺🇸
At 2% in at least one qualifying poll already.  Press and fundraising will help.  Also very achievable.  Let’s go!
Thanks Lissandra - great sharing the trail with you!  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks John - the Yang Gang is smart and thinks ahead.  😀👍
You all are amazing!  👍🇺🇸
If I were a photographer I would ask political candidates to do increasingly ridiculous things during a photo shoot to see what their limits are.  I have a feeling you’d wind up with some pretty funny photos.
Thank you Common Defense for your leadership and service.  Let’s get the power to declare war back to Congress where it belongs in the Constitution.  👍🇺🇸
Finally reading The Righteous Mind by @JonHaidt - suggests that liberals need to argue more from foundations of loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty as well as caring and fairness. Thanks Jon - will take it to heart.
Things can change very quickly nowadays.  For better or worse.
We have a chance to do something incredible with this campaign. Let’s make the most of it.  🥊👍🇺🇸
One month until the first DNC debate in Miami on NBC!  We will be having a rally in Miami leading up.  🇺🇸🥊Going to be quite the #YangGang celebration.  😀🎉
You do get the feeling that Kawhi is heading elsewhere no matter what happens in the Finals.
Thank you for being such an awesome champion to Detroit and @venture4america over the years. I learned a lot from you and will always be in your debt.
Rest well and get well soon @cavsdan! Your city and country need you. 🇺🇸🙏👍
You get the feeling that we would all be better off with more three-day weekends.
“i have striven not to laugh at human actions, not to weep at them, not to hate them, but to understand them.” - Spinoza
Well that was impressive.  Toronto in 7.
Biggest game in franchise history for Toronto.  No pressure.
Thanks #YangGang 😀👍
One definition of prosperity in America - bring able to host a good barbecue.  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Michael 👍
I have been listening to the Greatest Showman Reimagined on the road and it is mesmerizing.
Thanks @JenniFink_
The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
Congrats on following this Annie!  Throw in a mention of me next time.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you Caroline!  😀👍
Every time I make a choice I’m like “This is the kind of judgment we need in the White House!”  Chicken or fish?  Almonds or cashews?  So many choices.
Thanks Marcellus!  😀🇺🇸👍 You’re a champ.
Excited for a convo with @PreetBharara later today - been a fan for quite some time.  👍🇺🇸
I’d like to show up to other candidates’ events and ask them what they think about Universal Basic Income.  😀🇺🇸
@JonesOnTheNBA too
@CJMcCollum is on point
Having journalists who are paid tens of thousands of dollars a year and work in a contracting industry being responsible for the additional award of tens of millions of dollars to pro athletes whom they are in regular contact with seems like something you would want to avoid.
So of course Toronto pulls it out.  Oh well.  They also have homecourt against the Warriors - hope the East can make it a series.
Find myself going for the Bucks because they seem like a tougher roadblock for the Warriors.
Thanks Matt.  Will be there before long 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Mark
Thanks Matt.  Did you go to CTY?
There should be a rule that if Andrew Yang passes you in the polls you must drop out and endorse him.
Buy in now people the surge is coming.  😀
If our political leadership remains decades behind the curve we will never catch up.
Someone said to me yesterday they liked my Twitter account because “it’s obvious it’s you.”  High praise.  😀
Just trying to help Nancy 😀🇺🇸
Thank you - you all are amazing!!  😀👍🙏🇺🇸
Thank you!!
Thanks Lacey!  😀👍🙏
Thank you for being part of it!  😀👍🙏
Thanks Emil.
I kick in at around the 4 minute mark.  😀👍
@Booksmart
Cash is king.
My family benefited tremendously from immigrating to this country and I was lucky to be born here.  Time to pay it back.  🇺🇸
Most Americans lack meaningful retirement savings and pensions disappeared in the private sector years ago. We will need to strengthen Social Security and our healthcare systems as our population ages. Let’s pay it forward.
Overrated experience in my opinion: skydiving. I found it more uncomfortable than exhilarating.  Underrated: hang gliding. I was a bit of a novelty-seeker in my twenties. Made it easier to settle down.
@ProfEmilyOster ever true 👍
Thanks a ton for your support all!  In Iowa and the new polling data is our best yet.  If we have the resources to get the word out we will contend and win the whole thing.  Thank you for making it happen!  😀👍🥊
Certainly the recently passed abortion laws in Alabama and other states are dramatic moves in the wrong direction.  We should #stopthebans and protect women’s reproductive rights.
One of my favorite things about Iowa: Pizza Ranch.  Unlimited pizza buffet known for their fried chicken.  How has this not swept the nation?
Thanks Chris - I sense it too.  😀🇺🇸
Geez the Warriors are at half-strength and they still get the sweep.  Darn.
There should be a Hand of the President.
Heading to Iowa to see some friends in Des Moines @bpmilne @albertwenger and speak at @moneterysummit 👍🇺🇸 From SC to Iowa someone must be running for President 😀
2x isn’t quite exponential but it will do the trick.  😀👍
If you think this is a novelty MGM just fired its bartenders in Vegas impacting hundreds.  This is real.
8% of US jobs are in STEM fields.  92% are not.  If someone thinks they can train 92% of workers for roles presently occupied by 8% of workers they have a rather fanciful view of both people and work.
Thanks @nancyscola - enjoyed the conversation a great deal.  👍🇺🇸
I’m going to miss that show.
I should say biggest show on TV. Quality is subjective. I had issues with the last season but was compelled throughout.
That was a beautiful ending to the best show on TV.
Waiting to watch it until later tonight 😀👍
The truth is the majority of Americans get their news from a source other than cable news. People listen to their friends first and foremost and get their info from podcasts and other new media; it’s one reason this campaign has taken people by surprise. 🥊
Would be glad to go on MSNBC or any other network too.  Enjoyed CNN and Business Insider.  If you give the #YangGang the opportunity you will see big ratings.  😀👍
I’d be glad to go on Fox for a town hall - and I think the DNC boycotting the network for its debates is a mistake. We are trying to win elections and the best way to persuade people of your point of view is to engage with them. Not talking to someone generally doesn’t work.👍🇺🇸
Hard to believe Game of Thrones ends tonight. I don’t know if we will see anything like it ever again.
Just landed in South Carolina - excited to see everyone!  👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  😀
Thanks all - coming back your way soon!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Bill!  😀👍🥊
You see a story about an NBA player getting banned for 2 years due to drug use and you think “We’re all human.”  You never know what people are going through.  I hope Tyreke gets the support he needs and comes back strong.
Thank you!   You are not the only one.  😀👍
I’ll be back to New Hampshire myself in no time 😀👍🇺🇸
To be clear that is $3.5 million in Q2.  We raised $1.7 million in Q1 and have already raised more than $1 million in Q2.  👍😀
Just paid $4 for a bottle of water at the airport after throwing one out in security.  There should be a rule on pricing in airports.  Just saying.
Castigating all public schools or all charter schools does educators a massive disservice by calling into question the work they do with our kids every day. We should be looking to make all of their jobs easier by putting resources into both schools and households.
Of course there are thousands of dedicated teachers in public schools who are doing incredible work each day. They deserve higher pay more respect and more support. They also deserve more flexibility in how they do their jobs.
I have friends who have put their heart and soul into charter schools for underprivileged kids who were being failed by our public school system. Many changed thousands of lives for the better. I admire their work a great deal. They were there for the kids. No other reason.
There are very good public schools and very bad public schools. There are very good charter schools and very bad charter schools. The goal should be to make more schools high-quality and effective - not denounce an entire category.
The Democratic Party could use some new ideas.
NBC, the New York Times and others are doing features on the candidates who make the Democratic debates in June. The spotlight will shine beyond the night itself and the commentary thereafter.  👍
I was just playing basketball and we started shouting out the names of presidential candidates as we shot the ball.  “Bill DeBlasio!”  “Tulsi Gabbard!”  Added a lot of energy.  I won on Elizabeth Warren.
Thanks!
Sometimes people ask me if I knew the campaign would do this well.  I always believed we would.  The most surprising thing to me is just how winnable this race is.
Thanks to you all we are guaranteed a spot on the debate stage by meeting both the donor and the polling thresholds. That’s for both of the debates in June and July.  Thank you!!  We will make the most of it.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Progress bar will be up soon.  Thank you!  👍🎉🇺🇸
We are fighting the illusion of power.  We can win.
Instead of pardoning billionaires I’d pardon non-violent marijuana and opiate offenders.
Any members of the press - you might want to be there.  It will be newsworthy.  Tell your editors.  😀👍
I will say that this is about the only thing that might get rich parents to move to poor neighborhoods.
We invented the SAT during World War II to identify smart kids to keep away from the frontlines.  Now every year is wartime.
I should know.  I was quite good at them.
Most of that money would add to economic activity and growth in our communities and neighborhoods.  It doesn’t disappear.  Quite the opposite.  It would bolster a trickle-up economy from our families and people up.  It would make our economy much more dynamic and mobile.
Now we have to debate it in the most important arena of all - the American public.  If enough of us get together we can make it real.  Change can happen faster than most believe possible.
Universal Basic Income is becoming more and more mainstream - it has gone from marginal idea to a proposal debated in major publications and institutions.  The truth is it is inevitable - and the sooner we make it happen the better off we will be.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Nate!  😀👍
I personally don’t think male legislators should be weighing in on women’s reproductive rights and freedoms.  It should be up to women. I’m happy to let women decide for themselves.
My wife is a champ.  That is all.
The Alabama law banning and criminalizing abortion even in cases of rape or incest is a dramatic step in the wrong direction.  Government should not be making decisions on behalf of women.  I would protect women’s right to choose.
Warriors in 6.  Bucks in 7.
Our NYC rally tonight will be live streamed on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and here on Twitter at 6 ET!  Be sure to tune in 🇺🇸👍🏽😀!
Ha thanks Tyler 👍
Apparently we made the @nytimes crossword puzzle this morning - the #YangGang has arrived.  😀👍
“It’s not red or blue.  It’s green.  Give money.” - @Pharrell
For anyone concerned that our government is behind the curve on technology you are right. We are 24 years behind. Congress got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995 and we have been flying blind. I would bring back the OTA and get us up to speed as fast as possible.
The future tends to creep up on you slowly - and then it moves very quickly.
Thanks Lissandra - great spending time with you on the trail.  👍🇺🇸
One positive byproduct of this campaign - millions of Americans are going to hear the words “Fourth Industrial Revolution” and understand that we are undergoing the greatest economic and technological transformation in human history.  👍🇺🇸
Just finished Town Halls in New Hampshire with @marchandsteve in Claremont, Hollis, Windham and Milford addressing hundreds of NH primary voters. We are going to grow fast in New Hampshire.  👍🇺🇸
Thank you Dave!!  👍
The Bucks or Raptors have homecourt against the Warriors.  The Bucks in particular can compete with them.
Man the Warriors just will not lose.  Feel for Chris Paul.  This was his chance to put his stamp on it.
This trip in New Hampshire is going great!  @marchandsteve @khrystinausa are big difference makers.  👍😀🇺🇸
Happily our crowds are getting bigger all of the time.  Appreciate everyone who shows up.  We have come a long way - and they haven’t seen anything yet.  🙏😀🎉
You can always tell a poorly attended political event by the camera angles and up close photos.  😀
A voter in Lebanon New Hampshire on why he’s supporting me: “You’re the only candidate who is for a Universal Basic Income. That would be a lifesaver in my household.”
It’s past $3 million now actually.  😀
Thanks Holly it was great spending time with you in Iowa!  👍🇺🇸😀
Hey @seanseaevans would love to be on Hot Ones.  I’m not the best with hot wings but I think could at least do better than @djkhaled.  👍
Jess is definitely human 😀👍
Thank you Gareth!!
The rent is too damn high.
Entrepreneurs are some of my favorite people. But it’s not realistic or a good fit for everyone. The danger of overhyping entrepreneurship is that we substitute “be your own boss” for functioning organizations and supports. Everyone should have a chance without being a superhero.
Holy crap I think KD just tore his Achilles.
LeBron should demand a trade.  To the Clippers.
Warriors-Rockets is the game of the year. Why do I feel like the Rockets break through?  They seem very motivated.    Kyrie to the Nets - or Knicks if they get KD.
If Joe Biden doesn’t think that China is competing with the US he must not be paying attention to AI.
Trusting in people is the best path forward. We have to start believing in ourselves.
Riding a bike is the best.
Will be joined by @marchandsteve who has already taught me a lot 👍🇺🇸🙏
I just got a text message from my own campaign.  It works.  😀👍
Every shooting hurts.  Let’s do something about it while it still hurts.  The danger is we become numb and it becomes commonplace.  We can do much more - we owe it to the next generation to rise to the challenge of school shootings via both improved mental health and gun safety.
Glad to be here Bret 👍🇺🇸
Probably more like 6 ET
Thanks Jon!  Let’s do it!
Fighting for what you believe in often connects you with amazing people.  Thank you.
Vi in Minneapolis said it best: “I didn’t think I deserved a thousand bucks a month.  Then I realized of course I did.  Now spreading the word has made me feel energized.”  👍🇺🇸
Howard Schultz: “Even Westeros needs a Starbucks.”
Every time someone donates it is awesome. Today it is Jennifer Thompson from Georgia, Candice Lupo from Oklahoma and John Palmer from Illinois.  Thank you for your support and enthusiasm.  😀👍🇺🇸
Yes they did.  👍😀🇺🇸
The United States used to represent the future to people around the world. We need to have that sense again instead of seeming like our best days are behind us and that we are stuck reaching into the past. We can solve the problems and create a better more modern path forward. 🇺🇸
Turns out MATH can stand for a few things - Make America Think Harder (or THink).  Move America Towards Humanity.  Make American Truckers Hopeful.  Other suggestions welcome.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Matias!
Thanks Charlie!!
Thank you!!  🙏🇺🇸🥊
Thank you and great to share the Fassi family’s story.  Now let’s provide the Freedom Dividend for every family in America.  👍🇺🇸  We can easily afford it.  The time is now.
Had a tremendous time back in Detroit - see you in July for the debates!!  😀👍🇺🇸🎉
Had a blast Detroit - be back in July for the debates!!  #YangGang 👍😀🇺🇸
This is a very high variance campaign.  No one knows our limit.  That’s why we will win.
We should do an 8 Mile re-enactment in Detroit today! “You think you know me?  I know everything you’re about to say against me!  I am unknown, I’m not a politician, I do want to give everyone money! You don’t know what I’ve been through! But I know something about you . . .”
Just landed!  “Hello Seattle - I’m listening.”
Last I checked the person with the most votes is the most electable.
You know what America will be asking during the debates: “Who is the Asian guy standing next to Joe Biden?”  😀
I get asked all the time what my plan for the debates is. I admit I’ve been looking forward to them for a while. I was on the US national debate and public speaking team in 1992. Will be a great opportunity to introduce myself to millions of Americans.
Congrats to the teachers across South Carolina rallying for better conditions & higher pay. Teachers need to be paid more full stop. I will be making my first trip to the state this month and am excited for it.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Running for President only highlights for me how little voice most Americans have. Our feedback mechanisms haven’t been functioning properly for years. Let’s change it.
I like lasagna too.
Thanks for this!  😀👍
I find that many things seem smaller the closer you get.  This campaign is the opposite.  The more people dig the more they get it.
By plane I mean coach.  😀
I don’t ask staffers to ride next to me on the plane. Who wants to ride next to their boss?
Yes I do.  😀👍🇺🇸
Running for President is a lot of fun if you do it with the right people.  Thank you.  👍🙏🇺🇸
One of my favorite essays growing up was “Shooting an Elephant” by George Orwell.  He was very perceptive.
Supporter 😀👍
A mayor said to me “You can say things that I can’t. Keep going,”  Those are my favorite politicians.
“The battle between good and evil is a legitimate theme for . . any work of fiction, but in real life that battle is fought chiefly in the individual human heart. .. In real life, the hardest aspect of the battle between good and evil is determining which is which.” @GRRMspeaking
Working on it.  Will definitely be back!  Loved Austin 😀👍
Instead of chasing symptoms let’s cure the disease.  The disease is pervasive financial insecurity driven by an increasingly inhuman economy - and AI is about to become a game changer for many companies and workers.
Saw the Avengers after the Town Hall last night.  Enjoyed it!  Now no one can spoil it for me either.  😀
Thanks for making the trip Tacia!!  😀👍
.@LionelMoise too!  😀👍🇺🇸
I’ve walked away with 3 microphones strapped to my body so far in this campaign.  Sorry @YahooNews.  My latest victim.
As the son of immigrants I eat odd-looking but tasty stuff all of the time.
Excited for this!
Congrats on this Scott!  Learned a lot from you.  👍
Thank you!!  😀👍
Thanks Scott 👍
A woman in Boone County, Iowa told me that she had read my book and was giving it to everyone she knows.  This made me very happy.
Someone said to my wife that even watching my activities makes them feel tired. Well I feel the same way when I see how hard my wife works with our kids each day.
This campaign has had a mindset of abundance since the beginning.  Thank you for making it right.  👍🙏
Haha
This campaign is the essence of democracy. The only thing standing between us and the White House is getting more people on board.  😀👍🇺🇸
Shout out to @scottsantens who originated this 🙏👍
Thanks Gareth!!
Thank you Brittany- great meeting you last night!  😀👍
Thanks Josh!
Thanks!  😀👍
Nothing like running for President to make you seem young.
Well that was the most intense episode of TV in quite some time.
I was invited to the White House Correspondents dinner this weekend but was busy campaigning here in Iowa.  Will be glad to attend as President.  😀
Thanks Joey!  😀👍
Great to see you Tyler- thanks for being one of the originals!  😀👍
1:15 👍
Heading on @msnbc at around 1 ET to talk about the campaign 👍🇺🇸
If @JDScholten were an Avenger he would definitely be Thor.  I’d be Iron Man.  😀
Someone today asked me if I knew I was going to run for President. Of course not. Being a politician seemed like a job I wouldn’t want. I’m more of a get-things-done type. But sometimes you wind up doing something surprising. Many of us will rise to this occasion.
There was no dancing.  Disappointing.  😀
Our hearts go out to the families affected by the synagogue attack in San Diego. Attacks on Americans worshipping in peace are particularly hateful and devastating. There is no place in America for this sort of hate. #HumanityFirst
Haha
Someone just suggested to me that we have a philosopher in the White House.  Great idea.
It’s not hard for me to avoid taking money from lobbyists as it’s hard to imagine them backing my campaign.
Thanks Jess!  😀👍
Thank you Gareth!  That’s amazing 🙏😀
NBA Round 2 predictions:   Warriors in 6. Bucks in 6. MVP. Raptors in 6.  Nuggets in 7.  I think they get there.    The Warriors seem like they are tempting fate. But it’s hard to see them losing 4 games. I’m rooting for a new champ all the same.
In all seriousness learned a lot visiting this ethanol processing plant in Gowrie, Iowa.  Very clean and even more potential for renewable fuels.  👍🇺🇸
GDP is a flawed measurement that doesn’t reflect how we are doing. I’d be thrilled to celebrate an uptick in children’s health or a decrease in drug overdoses.
Many publications would make fine businesses with modest margins - but the margins aren’t high enough for public markets or private investors. New models are needed.
I’ve found that if you focus on executing on the things that are under your control the uncontrollable things tend to go your way more often.
The Giants should just play Saquon at quarterback.
Thanks Brian 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Parry - great meeting you.  😀🥊👍
The room was filled with hundreds of people not pictured here.  😀🇺🇸
Saying that every organization should “Think like a startup” is dumb. Different types of organizations have different time frames, different goals and different risk tolerances. They also employ different kinds of people. Startups should think like startups.
On the plane to Iowa and someone shouts out “Yang Gang!”  Love it.  😀
Glad Joe Biden is running.  This race wouldn’t be the same without him.  👍🇺🇸
The stealth thing that makes you feel your age - when there’s a pro athlete (e.g. Steph Curry) and you’re like “Oh yeah I remember watching his Dad play.” You’ll know what I mean when Bronny goes pro.
Thanks Nate - I do love tacos and think all Americans should have access to good ones.  👍
Thanks Alexandra.  Enjoyed the conversation.  👍
Thanks Josh 👍
Thank you!  😀👍
This could be the Damian Lillard postseason.
Just found out the new Avengers is 3 hours long - looks like they are going out in style.
Committing a crime shouldn’t make you a non-citizen including your right to vote.
Ah Vegas. So many awkward bachelor party memories.
Thank you @danieldaekim for the support!  Been a fan since Lost.  😀#YangGang
Seeing old friends on the trail is one of the best parts of running for President. You remember who you are and experiences you shared at different times in your life.
Every day around here is a great day thanks to the #YangGang.  😀👍🇺🇸  Thank you.
Thank you Jeanne - agree that changing the rules to make it harder for college students to vote is the wrong direction. We should be encouraging young people to vote where they prefer and even lower the voting age to 16. The more young people who are engaged the better.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Anand and Greg.  Certainly count me among those who believe our economic system needs to fundamentally transform in order to serve people.  We aren’t economic inputs.  The market should exist to serve our goals and values not the other way around.  👍🇺🇸 @RoKhanna
Thanks Josh - enjoyed speaking a great deal.  👍
The attacks in Sri Lanka are a horrific tragedy.  Our heartfelt condolences to the individuals and families who were victims of this senseless attack, particularly Christian communities who were celebrating in peace.  #HumanityFirst
Knowing there is a new episode of Game of Thrones tonight is a pleasant unfamiliar feeling.
Happy Easter Sunday!  Enjoy time with your family.  😀👍
“You’re only powerless if you believe you’re powerless.” - Jamie Foxx
The best response in an era of institutional failure and mistrust is to strengthen people.
Smart companies say they invest in their people all of the time. In the public sector we do the opposite - and then we all wind up paying the price. We need to invest in ourselves and then we will all win. #FreedomDividend #HumanityFirst
They use both criteria as a tiebreaker.  We will be on stage in June and July for sure.  👍😀
Love the fact that they are using a local currency for small businesses.  We can do a lot more directing of resources than most people realize.
Thanks Phil 👍
Playing basketball in the driveway while the sun goes down is one of the best things in life.
Thanks Billy enjoyed the convo a great deal 👍
Thanks Tyler 👍😀
Thank you so glad to be with you all!  You are the best!  😀🎉🙏
2% if you include undeclared - still trending up from their last survey 👏😀
I’ve found that doing work you’re excited about helps you stay young in spirit.
Make that had a blast.  😀  Be back soon!!!
I remember when Manhattan Prep was starting out - in lean times there was a “no spending” rule. No one was allowed to spend any money. You would find other ways to get things done for a while and do only things that didn’t cost anything. I feel like a lot of families can relate.
I am glad that the Mueller Report has been made public. It’s important to the American people. My focus is on beating Donald Trump at the ballot box and solving the problems that got him elected in the first place.
I live on KIND bars and green tea on the road.  Thanks @DanielLubetzky 👍.
Jamie Dimon coming out for a national negative income tax - a guaranteed minimum income - is a huge deal.  He understands the enormity of the problems and is right to consider this a national emergency.  👍🇺🇸
Bernie Sanders knows better than anyone what it is like to be excluded by establishment politicians. It’s too bad that he is not more open to this campaign as I know many people who like us both.  👍🇺🇸
About to head on @FoxNews with @ShannonBream a bit after 11 pm.  Too late?  Nah.
Thank you Adam!!  👍😀
Thank you Jason!!  😀👍
Looks like I’m heading there in June.  No petition necessary!  😀👍
Heading on @MSNBC with @SRuhle at 9:15 or so 👍😀
Thanks Myk.  👍
On it 👍
12-year old today:  “Good luck with the, uh, running for President thing!”  Me:  “Thanks!”
In college there were many more people who wanted to be doctors than there were spots for.  Meanwhile there are now massive primary care deserts across the country. If we need more doctors we should train more instead of having the number stay constant due to med school limits.
Yes - let’s make Universal Basic Income a reality in the US as quickly as possible.  👍🇺🇸
I took a 15-year break from hair product.
Jack Dorsey also donated.  More people join the #YangGang all the time.  👍
Thank you @jack for the support!  I use at least one of your products every day.  👍
Ooh I love my new Twitter header pic. My Team does such great work.
I will put our celebrity donor list of Nicolas Cage, Rivers Cuomo, Noah Centineo and Sam Altman up against anyone’s.  😀
People will discount us the whole way. I will say that going from anonymous to making the debate stage and polling nationally is likely a harder jump than going from our current 3% to contending.  👍🇺🇸 We are going to shock the world.
For what it’s worth I’d be happy to do a Town Hall on @FoxNews or @MSNBC. Or just about any other platform that would reach a large number of Americans. The whole point is to reach as many Americans as possible.  👍🇺🇸
This is the Andrew Yang Show, it’s not the Yang Andrew Show, this is my favorite show.  👍😀
Thanks Tom!  👍
Riding the Amtrak back from DC with the team celebrating a FANTASTIC few days in the capital.  We are at 3% drawing crowds around the country - and we are just getting started.  👍🇺🇸
Hope to meet him and you in the trail Leah!  👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  👍🇺🇸
Thank you for being there!!  😀👍🇺🇸
Wait until more Americans hear about me.  👍🇺🇸
I love the #YangGang - such an amazing group of people there today at a phenomenal historic site.  We will be back!!
Someone just told me that I earned her vote.  Always great to hear.  😀👍
Thank you Tony!!
Yes would have loved a question on student loan debt.  Feel very strongly about the fact that it is ridiculous and unjust.  Will do something about it.  👍
Also agree with greater access to other treatments.  Have to do everything under the sun to give people a chance to beat addiction.  👍
Please try again!  Must have been Actblue for a little bit. 👍
Yes it is a great time.  😀 Thanks!
Thanks Mason!
Thanks Aminka!  Will do 🥊
That’s phenomenal Ross.  Hope they enjoyed it.
Glad to be able to bring you two together.  👍🙏 Thank you.
Amazing thank you!
Will check it out
Thank you Steve!
Thanks Jared!
Means a lot Aly 🙏.  Thank you.
Thank you John!
Awesome!
I like your thinking Anton.
Thanks Nicole!
Thank you!
Thank you Jess!  You’re the best.  😀
Thanks David!
It also made me think “maybe more characters will survive than I’d originally thought.”
The premiere of Game of Thrones made me think “there is no way they can wrap this up in 5 more episodes.”
Thank you John!  👍
Thank you for the help - really appreciate the support!  Let’s get to work.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Now driving to watch Game of Thrones premiere.  😀
Thank you for coming out for the Town Hall!  Enjoyed it a great deal and it was a great night for the campaign.  😀👍🇺🇸  Let’s fight for Humanity.  #YangGang See you soon on the trail!
Excited for the town hall tonight at 7!  👍🇺🇸
Congrats to Poirier. Been a fan for a long time. He earned it the hard way.  👍🥊💎
I am getting stronger all the time.  Thanks for believing in me.  💪🥊👏
I’m a big fan of trains and wish the US had more modern railways. Heard recently that airlines have lobbied against high-speed trains that would reduce business across particular routes. Trains would be better for the environment and on other levels.
I don’t have any complaints.  I remember riding the bus a lot when I was younger.  Compared to that Amtrak feels great. 😀
Generally speaking booing your team doesn’t make them play better.
Awesome!  👍🇺🇸
Regional
On my way to DC for the CNN Town Hall on Sunday at 7!  Riding the private jet known as the Amtrak.
Disagree - freeing up the President’s time is a big deal. Imagine if the time is spent building relationships with legislators that gets an important bill across the finish line. This increases those opportunities.
Spring always seems to start on the same day as the NBA Playoffs.
Thank you!!  👍😀
The Star Wars trailer gave me mixed emotions.
.@yang_campaign is the new staff twitter account for campaign news also @Zach_Graumann for behind the scenes stuff from the trail from my campaign manager.  👍🇺🇸😀
A woman just came up to me and said “Are you Andrew Yang?” Then before I could say anything she said “No, no you’re not” apologized and walked away.
If I were to advocate for any change it would be to make states award electors proportionally instead of winner-take-all. This would lead candidates to campaign everywhere and not just the ~12 battleground states. I believe Americans would appreciate this change a great deal.
Third, it runs the risk of making Democrats seem like we are losing elections by the rules that have been in place for decades so we need to change the rules. That’s a very unprincipled place to be.  We need to win an election by the rules we have before we call for any changes.
Second, the incentives would drive candidates to campaign in high-density cities and big media markets.  It would skew both campaigns and policies against lower-density rural areas in a very direct way.
First, getting rid of the Electoral College would require a Constitutional amendment. This would be a non-starter with many legislators whose states would lose electors.  It’s an impractical conversation to raise.
I think Democrats calling for getting rid of the Electoral College are off-base for a few reasons. Of course I get the beauty and simplicity of saying “whoever gets more votes wins.” It seems like the essence of democracy and has a strong innate appeal.
The best thing about being powered by small donors is getting to focus on getting the word out and introducing myself to as many Americans as possible.  Thank you.  👍🇺🇸🙏
My hair and makeup will last all day.  😀
Thanks!
NBA Playoff Predictions:   Warriors in 5 Nuggets in 7  Thunder in 6 Rockets in 7   Bucks in 4 Raptors in 5 Sixers in 6 Celtics in 7  Nets making playoffs is a testament to good management and culture-building
Thanks for this!  😀👍🇺🇸
Got asked yesterday about what I thought when I met Elizabeth Holmes in the White House. It wasn’t a long conversation. My main memory was that she had a deep voice.
Now when I make eye contact it tends to start a whole conversation.
This weekend:  1) Game of Thrones premiere 2) NBA Playoffs begin 3) CNN Town Hall on Sunday at 8 pm EST.  Seems like the best TV weekend in quite some time.  😀
Acceptance rates for selective high schools and colleges have plummeted over the past number of years as competition and interest have picked up. An obvious response: create new schools.  Instead of rewarding schools for being selective we should increase the number of spots.
Thanks Elon.  Hoping to build a future that helps keep people relevant and fruitful even as more work gets done by AI.  It’s a big challenge and we need to move fast.  👍
I went to high school and college in New England.  Feels very familiar every time I come back.
Wow. The Lakers may have just overtaken the Knicks as the most dysfunctional NBA franchise. And they have LeBron James!! That seems impossible.
#YangGang
Basic income would improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans overnight.  I do not see that as a corporate handout.
If you think a guaranteed government job is the same thing as Freedom we have a real difference in opinion.
Haha 😀
Amazing thanks Andy!
Maybe the end state we are working toward are the same thing.  Fighting for humanity and freedom.  👍
I love anything that helps people start businesses.  👍 Thank you for your service.  🇺🇸🙏
Love this!  😀
Thank you Alyssa!  😀
I should start introducing myself as Andrew Yang of House Yang, One Millionth of His Name, King of Nothing in Particular, Securer of The Bag, Father of Humans, Entrepreneur of the People, the Unbought, the Bringer of Abundance.
Thank you Jessica!  Will try and get your neighbors to join you.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you!!  Can honestly say I never saw this coming.  😀
Scarcity won’t save us or provide a path forward.  Abundance will.
Learned a lot from @lessig and campaign finance reform activists this weekend.  Fixing our broken system where money wins and people lose is a top priority.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks @JohnBerman enjoyed the interview 👍🇺🇸
This game nuts.
A lot had to go right for me to be in position to fight for other people.  I plan to make the most of it.
Things tend to get better or worse in different respects. They seldom stay the same.
Yes
Miami end of June at the latest 👍
The opposite of humanity may be bureaucracy.
Other campaigns better show up in New Hampshire because the #YangGang is strong there and getting stronger. I will be here every chance I get and grind for each and every vote. The future of the country lies here.  Love you NH.  👍🇺🇸
We are looking to hire another Andrew on the campaign. As a result I have started to speak in the third person. “Andrew is doing a great job.” “Andrew likes chicken.”
If I win I would truly be the Podcast President.  👍😀🇺🇸
“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” - Upton Sinclair
My tips - make the core numbers work. Always be honest with your people.  And don’t get so wrapped up in your goals that you lose perspective.  👍
The toughest thing about balancing a mindset of abundance with a mindset of scarcity is that they both can be correct and helpful in the same day.  Too much of an abundance mindset and you wind up with Fyre Festival.
Looking forward to this 👍
It’s early but this Mets season feels good.
Numbers can obscure but they don’t often lie.
Thanks Joy - looking forward to it!  👍🇺🇸😀
Was invited to the White House Correspondents Dinner but will be campaigning in Iowa that weekend.  Will be glad to attend as President.  😀👍🇺🇸
Excited to build the Dream Team!  Meeting people during this journey so too soon to say. But I will bring on leaders from different backgrounds and ideologies as long as they are solutions-oriented and share the big goals. 👍🇺🇸 The Yang Cabinet will be a joy to build and lead.
Thanks!  😀
I am an INTJ.
This is the campaign of ideas, solutions and compassion.  People will win again.  It’s our best hope.
Looking forward to this 👍
Let’s go get that money.
The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
Looking forward to this 👍
I have many friends who recently lost their jobs and are now in professional limbo. Highly educated types whom you would never worry about. There is an undercurrent to this economy that is stealthily pushing people to the sidelines - and these are supposed to be the good times.
First time seeing my face on a book cover - kind of strange.  In the past I made a comment that having one’s mug on the cover seemed political.  Then my publisher suggested it was a good idea after I became more of a thing.  Lesson learned.
We are in the midst of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The 1st was mechanization and steam. The 2nd was industrial production and factories. The 3rd was the Internet and digitization. AI and robotics will make this one the most dramatic and disruptive.
My CNN Town Hall is the hour before the Game of Thrones premiere on Sunday at 8.  So hopefully people will start watching TV an hour early.  😀
I am coming to grips with the fact that half of my favorite Game of Thrones characters will almost certainly die this month.
More than anything I appreciate the lively discussion and the ability to disagree. I would never expect someone to agree with me on everything but I hope that people can arrive at different conclusions while maintaining a general degree of openness. 😀👍 #respecttheprocess
16 year olds can drive and they pay taxes. The benefits of engaging citizens younger seem to outweigh the cons. But I would understand disagreement with this 👍😀.
To the fact that many 16 year olds are politically uninformed - sure. But it’s not like we are giving voters pop quizzes at the polls to see how much info they have. We have low information voters voting all of the time. There might be a correlation with other factors than age.
To me right now our electorate skews older on every dimension.  And our policies reflect it.  Younger people participate less and are disengaged.  Anything you can do to move the needle there you should explore.
I love the discussion on this one.  If you use full cerebral maturation as the main criterion you would raise the voting age from 18.  No one seems to be advocating for that realistically.
@AyannaPressley thank you for leading on this 👍🇺🇸
Holy cow I just found out my Mom follows me on Twitter.
I’m wearing something different right now.  😀
Thanks Topher
You know what causes stress?  Feeling like you don’t have control.  We have to give more Americans control of our own lives.
Thank you Ana - look forward to meeting you soon.  👍
CNN just announced that I will have a town hall next Sunday the 14th at 8 pm EST.  Most people are just becoming aware of me.  We are going to keep on growing and peak at the right time.
Thank you - very much looking forward to this!  😀👍🇺🇸
The astounding thing is ~95% of donations came in after February 11th.  We pretty much raised all of the money in the 2nd half of the quarter from small donors.  This bodes VERY well for our sustained growth.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks for being such a great partner and publisher Paul.  👍🙏
Pointing out the automation of jobs is helpful - championing the Freedom Dividend to enable millions of Americans to more effectively transition is the main thing.
Red eye flights are like lousy teleportation devices.
March was a huge month for the campaign and April is going to be even bigger.  👍😀
There are times when doing nothing is not cool.
This campaign feels very necessary.
It’s helpful to be simply fighting for what you believe.  You never have to remember what you’re supposed to think about something.
We are in the final day and are doing great!  Thank you for making this YOUR campaign.  😀👍🥊 With your support we can change the course of history.  🇺🇸
People can tell when you’re actually committed to something.  It makes a big difference.
You all are giving me the chance to fight for the future.  I appreciate it a great deal.  Thank you.  I promise to make the most of it.  👍🙏🇺🇸
Yes
Thanks Dorian!  😀
Sure
Too many.  Push?  Letter to Elise?  Charlotte Sometimes?  Could pick a dozen.
Me too 👍
Yes
Huge fan of DM
Asleep or How Soon is Now
Louder than Bombs.  Compilation but still.
Thank you Jon!  Appreciate it a great deal 👍
Head on the Door or Wish or Disintegration damn hard to say
Yes
Ha thanks
The Mets always seem to win Opening Day.  It’s the rest of the season you worry about.
Get on board now.  You’ll look smart in a little while.  😀
I support the right of workers to unionize and organize 👍🇺🇸
Thank you @chefzoot this is strong 👍🙏
Passerby: “Hey has anyone told you that you look like Andrew Yang?”  Me: “Yes.”
The first Democratic Primary debates will be on June 26th and 27th in Miami, Florida on NBC!  I know where I’ll be.  😀👍🇺🇸
Doing media on a campaign is a bit of delayed gratification - you spend time interviewing and then a week later it comes out.  And by then you are doing something else.
Parenthood is not easy.  Every parent pursues the best for their child while climbing over obstacles each day.  Entrepreneurship is defined as pursuing an opportunity without regard for resources currently under control. So in a way all parents are entrepreneurs.
Humanity First Tour locations and dates will be announced soon!  Looks like Boston will be one of the early stops in April.  😀👍
As a politician I’m a pretty good entrepreneur.
After we pass the Freedom Dividend millions of Americans will say “Wow the government did something right that really improves my life!”  There will be a lot of excitement.  Then we will get other things done too.  👍😀🇺🇸
Climate change is an existential threat that is about to speed up.  Real solutions are needed.  This is an area where our government has to lead to shift market incentives.  Kudos to the lawmakers who are stepping up to propose big steps in the right direction.
Frederick Douglass wrote that “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.”  He’s right.  What he left out is that it is also hard to build strong children.  We need to invest more in our kids from Day 1.
The tallest room I’ve ever been in - Chris Webber’s birthday party.
Little known fact about me - I was an entrepreneurship mentor for the NBA Players Association for a while.  Met many current and former players and felt quite short.  Being a pro athlete is much tougher than most imagine.
You know what I’m pretty sure works on a lot of problems?  Money.
I am going to find Bianca.  👍🇺🇸
I’m a very practical person.  If I find an approach isn’t working I’m very happy to try something else.  Following your preconceptions too far is a great way to find yourself in a ditch spinning your wheels going nowhere.
Thanks Dave 👍.  Great talking to you in NH.  Be back soon.
Breaking up with the Knicks was one of the best decisions of my life.  I feel freer.
I feared for the future of the US.  Then I started fighting for a better version.  Made me feel better almost immediately.  I highly recommend it.
Young people are depressed.  They have reason to be - we have left them an awful mess.  Let’s clean it up as fast as possible.
We have a reporting deadline on March 31st this Sunday - let’s finish the month on a high note!  THANK YOU.  👍😀🇺🇸
Apple is a little late to the game on content.  A lot to choose from and most people have made a streaming choice or two already.
We are going to need bigger venues for the Humanity First Tour.  😀
Thanks Jason 👍🇺🇸
Going to our event there is a ton of traffic.  Then we see a Yang Gang sign and realize it’s because of us.  😀
I remember when the press was trying to make Avenatti a thing.
I went from being the anonymous guy who wants to give everyone money to the legit Presidential candidate who wants to give everyone money.
Thanks Doug 👍🇺🇸
I always believed that the job is to beat Trump at the ballot box.  And then solve the problems that got him elected.  👍🇺🇸
Duke escapes.
Spring is here.
In the interim you often have escalating property taxes to pay overhead for schools because there are fewer households. This is a double whammy that drives people to leave and often makes selling one’s home difficult.
One problem in rural areas is shrinking schools. One school in northern New Hampshire had only 4 students in its graduating class. Consolidating school districts means long commutes for kids, letting teachers and administrators go, vacant schoolhouses and political battles.
I had Wonderboy.  Wow.
In a time of unprecedented change, dogma is unlikely to provide the best guidance.
Thanks!  👍
If we want to get serious about reducing waste in the US we should reexamine our packaging practices.
Thank you Fred 👍🇺🇸
Yes Ali - will be there!  👍
I’m not here to raise awareness.  I’m here to do a job.  Let’s go get it.
Apparently recidivism rates for certain violent crimes among men are very low partially because people age out and testosterone levels drop. Many did something as a teenager and then got released years later.
Just spent time with an ex-convict who helps reacclimate other formerly incarcerated men into society. He suggests tax breaks for hiring ex-cons. I’m for that but unfortunately don’t think it would do enough. Everyone deserves a second chance though - this guy is now thriving.
Looks like I’ll be on @cspan later today - might be my first time.
We will peak at the right time.  Getting stronger every day.  👍🇺🇸
As someone who was very good at standardized tests growing up I think they are a terrible measurement of anything other than whether you are good at the test. Certainly have nothing to do with human worth, character or virtue.
Thanks Kevin 👍🇺🇸
I find that not talking to people is a terrible way to convince them of anything.
.@benshapiro would be happy to have a convo - my team will follow up.
Heard I was mentioned on @jimmyfallon last night.  Sign of things to come.  😀👍
Yes you can David.  😀👍
The 4th Industrial Revolution and the rise of AI is no time for business as usual.
The Rise of the Yang Gang sounds like a movie I’d see.
We’re going to have to think a little bigger.
This economy stopped working for most people years ago. Unfortunately the winner-take-all dynamics are about to accelerate as technology and capital converge. The question is what to do about it.
My team is amazing - imagine having people whose job it is to make you look good.  I appreciate it every day.  They even got me a haircut.  😀 @Zach_Graumann
Never thought I’d be part of a Gang.  Just goes to show.  👍
Just to clarify - I support the freedom of parents to adopt circumcision for any religious or cultural ritual as desired. Actually have attended a brit milah myself and felt privileged to be there. Thanks Mikael.  Always up to parents.  👍
I don’t think tweaking rules is going to save us.
Not quite the cover but I’ll take it.  👍
Thanks Nate.  👍🇺🇸
Holy crap my Twitter handle just changed to @AndrewYang!  There can be only one.  😀
The plan is to tell the truth and listen to reason.  That’s the whole plan.
Um sold out in 25 minutes.  We get it - more on the way!!  😀👍🥊 Thank you for being such awesome passionate supporters!!  🙏🎉
Always give yourself a chance to win.
Would Zion Williamson be so epic if his name were Charles?  Parents take note.
People are the answer not the problem.
Over $1 million raised since Feb 12th!  Thank you for the incredible support!!  👍😀
Sometimes I think of this race without us in it and it makes me really glad we are doing this thing.
My father has a PhD in Physics.  I believe in science.
Thanks Nate and Galen.  You all do great work 👍🇺🇸
We all make mistakes.  It’s called humanity.
Someone today said I’m campaigning for the Federation.
Submissions welcome to depose the leader.  Please keep it clean.  😀👍
Criticizing someone for something they wrote as a teenager is stupid.
This may be the most meta campaign for President yet. 😀
Apparently the incentives for energy efficiency vary greatly across state lines based on differing costs.  If the Federal government were to elevate the incentives in low-cost states it would help spur a reduction in both consumption and pollution.
The ratio of days I have makeup on is getting higher.
Scheduled to appear at 8:45 this morning on @Morning_Joe!  Excited for it.  @MSNBC
Thanks to your donations we can focus on spreading the word.  THANK YOU.  I can’t tell you how good it feels to have your support.  Let’s take it all the way.  😀👍🇺🇸
Somehow the American people have become underdogs in our own land. That is messed up.  Let’s fix it.
Sometimes things can change very quickly.
Also Duke to win it.
Someone compared me to the movie ‘Dave.’  Except I look nothing like the guy.
This is not LeBron’s year.
Thank you Ashley!  😀👍 More to come too.
Thanks Nate 👍🇺🇸 More to come including ranked choice voting, moving some agencies to the Midwest and other good stuff.
Thanks @akarl_smith 👍
Thank you Adam 👍🇺🇸
We are going to have to do it ourselves.
The problem with deciding Presidential elections via popular vote is that candidates would naturally campaign in urban areas with big media markets and their policies would follow suit. Better to have proportional electoral college votes in each state so you campaign everywhere.
“A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.” - Paul Romer
Money doesn’t fix everything.  But it helps.
If you think things are going great I may not be your guy.  If you think we need significant changes to build an economy that works for people and families I might be just what you are looking for.
Scheduled to appear on @MSNBC tomorrow on @Morning_Joe to talk about my run for the White House. 👍🇺🇸
I don’t think people mind that much if you disagree with them as long as you respect their point of view and are open to learning more.
Turns out meeting someone online and meeting them in person are very different experiences.
In government most all of the time you are building consensus. You provide a vision and try to rally people around it. You build relationships. You compromise. You appeal to common goals. Things often happen more gradually. But when big things happen they can improve many lives.
As a CEO you can pretty much tell people what to do. You are their boss. You are paying them. If you say we are doing something then it generally happens. The downside is no one tells you unpleasant truths.
There are lessons and principles that government can take from business - like treating customers well and resource efficiency. But anyone who says they are going to “run government like a business” is dumb. They require very different forms of leadership.
We have to make Humanity an advantage.
Instead of all of these profiles on people who “made it” we should also show people’s struggles and pitfalls.  The success mythology fuels a lot of nonsense, guilt and misconception. Not every ending is Made for TV.
I started this campaign as a relative nobody who thought he could make a difference.  Thank you for proving me right.  👍🙏🇺🇸 Lets take it all the way.
Yeah maybe.  2 not good.
We may have to get rid of the penny.
I’m not sure skywriting is a good idea.
What is our potential?  Let’s find out.
A growth mindset is key.
A lot of people don’t pay attention to politics.  That is why we are going to win.
Perhaps math will unite the tribes.
Generally speaking our society should be a little more forgiving. Shame in particular loses power if overused. And beyond shame lies entropy.
Glad James Gunn is back.
If being recognized on the street is a sign of progress we are doing quite well.
Thanks Leslie - you inspire me and many others with your courage and character.  🥊👍🇺🇸
One of life’s mysteries - why is Mexican food better on the West Coast?
Tribalism is part of human nature.  When tribalism is distorted, amplified and poisoned terrible tragedies occur and atrocities become possible. The goal is to keep that from happening. That is our challenge.
As the son of immigrants attacks on immigrant communities pain me on on a personal level. Everyone wants to make a better life for their families.  There is a place for everyone. There is no place for hate.
The shooting in New Zealand is a horrific tragedy and reflects the worst form of depravity.  Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment are the opposite of what we stand for.  My heart goes out to the families and communities affected.  Love and humanity first.
Strong men treat women well.
Sometimes I get asked about our media strategy.  Our strategy was to say yes to whomever asked.  Just trying to introduce myself to as many Americans as possible.  👍🇺🇸
Thank you Shireen.
Traveling with my staff, I told someone to secure the bag.
Yes I’m sure we will continue to be.
I hear you.  Thanks for understanding.  👍
I grew up in upstate New York.  Love the country dearly.  Doing what I think is right.  If I imagine dark things that may be on me.  Don’t mean to attack anyone.  Trying to solve problems.  Appreciate anyone else who wants to solve problems too.  👍🇺🇸
I get it.  Don’t mean to bring anyone’s race into anything.  Again trying to address the problems that affect us all.  👍
I have the feeling that if we descend into automation-fueled madness and scarcity then terrible things will happen.  And yes that could well be one of them.
Reason it’s been done in the past.
You are the best Marianne.  👍🙏❤️. Learning from you.
Thanks Adam
Historically speaking the Asian American community has been somewhat disengaged.  If I’m talking to them I’m trying to wake them up to the fact that we have to start pulling for each other and other communities.  All one country 🇺🇸
My campaign is about calling out the reality of what is happening to us.  We are being ground up.  It is tearing us apart.  It will take Herculean efforts to keep us together.  Pretending that the descent will be gentle doesn’t help anyone.
We are the most heavily armed country in the history of the world.  Everyone knows what I think is ahead. Why would one imagine disintegration to be gentle?  It will not be.  For any of us.
Violence has occurred in several black churches and Jewish synagogues in the last years. It would be awfully optimistic to think that something similar would not happen to other communities.  I am trying to keep the country strong and whole for my kids and yours.  👍🇺🇸
Thank you Brent 👍🇺🇸
It’s true Dutch was first.  😀👍🇺🇸
Agree to disagree.  Will get worked out in Congress and the American people 👍🇺🇸
If we insist on seeing ourselves as inputs into the economic machine we are doomed.  We have to make this economy work for people as fast as possible.
Mass riots labor unions universal high school in 1911 etc.  this time 3-4 times faster with bigger more complex economy
Going to get costs and loans down too 👍
Depends if you include possibly preserving our way of life.
Less than 3 trillion.  Existing programs reduce the cost significantly.  👍
Thank you Joby 🙏👍
Thank you
Like checks and balances 👍🇺🇸
If I’d have been President earlier I would have done it for you
Start with higher interest rates first so mostly private
Thank you 👍
Thanks for the opportunity.  Bernie and I are aligned on the goals and values I believe. Differ in some of the approaches and problem definitions.  I supported him last time and we all owe him for elevating the right issues. Up to you whose approaches you prefer.  👍🇺🇸
Your story is not the only one.
Will take care of vets.  Right thing to do.  👍🇺🇸🙏
The wave will grow.  Most have still never heard of me.  😀
Thank you!!  🙏 Means a lot.  👍
Thank you David.  Would love that too.  👍
A student in Iowa said to me last night “I’d love to vote for someone I actually like instead of voting for someone I dislike less.”  Made me happy because it seemed she was talking about me.
Everyone hates student loan debt.  Not just well-off.  Plan will include some investment on part of borrower in most cases. 👍
Massive treatment initiative
I like where your head’s at.  😀
Still no to all of the above
Yes I do
I love this and support a large-scale forgiveness plan.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Alyssa!!  Be in touch soon!  😀👍
Check back in a month 😀
None of this is true.  Please take a bit of time to look at my platform.  👍
As a parent I agree with this 👍
You know it.  👍🥊
Would enjoy that 👍
Lots of administrative work
Soon.  😀👍
Thanks Erez
Thanks Devin 👍
Thanks Jason 👍
Shoot sorry Kathy.  Didn’t intend to unfollow you.  Sometimes a staffer maintains my Twitter.  Back now.  👍😀
Definitely coming back soon
People who just show up to kick ass are the best.
We will see.  👍🇺🇸
Would love that.
Thanks Tony 👍🇺🇸
Will have a name soon I think
Thanks Ronald 👍
@TomSteyer will fund it 😀👍🇺🇸
Tougher to exploit workers who can walk away and survive without you 👍
Think there is middle ground where we can agree.  Respect different experiences and perspectives.
Jeff will pay a lot more than he gets
Am open to all measures.
Thanks Jay
Thank you
It’s going to be very hard to regulate 3-D printed guns.  Some may be plastic. No good answers.
Thank you Melanie.  Means a lot.  👍
Always open and would enjoy that
Against the practice.
1 way street for regulators.  Big pay raise.  But no going back to industry.
Negative on it
Thanks Jude 🙏❤️
More than 11 million Americans are addicted to opioids - many of whom are struggling in silence or not seeking treatment for fear of criminal prosecution. We should consider the case for decriminalizing opiates in order to more effectively treat more people for addiction.
Citizens
Thanks Mason 👍🇺🇸
No.  Saying that they wouldn’t.
That doesn’t get money from Amazon or help people whose jobs get eliminated
Agree.  Think there are ways we can ID and curb fake news without curtailing press.  Requires incentives beyond clickbait.
Exactly.  If Congress won’t do it then it won’t happen.
Of course not.  Have to get Congress to pass laws.  That’s how it works.  👍🇺🇸
Alaska.  Many other trials.  But yes let’s run large-scale pilots ASAP.
What is more important - gun industry profits or human lives?  There is plenty of zone for agreement for responsible gun owners and people who want to rein in excesses.
Yes website has resources
Thanks Eli!  👍🇺🇸
Thanks for educating me Eric.  👍😀
Have spent years operationalizing a vision.  👍
Decreases income inequality mathematically 👍
Thanks Cameron.  Got to get those numbers up.  😀👍🇺🇸
Not a venture capitalist.  Started non-profit that helped train young entrepreneurs.
Yes
Thank you Vanessa!  😀👍🇺🇸
Thank you 👍
Good day to be a Browns fan.
That is nuts
Yes you did 👍🇺🇸
It’s a tough issue.  People will disagree.
Thanks Maegan 👍
👍
Thanks Dan
Thanks Scott.  Would love to catch up.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks we will work on them 👍
Would never imagine you were.  And of course would love to sit down.
Confiscating guns from private homes is unrealistic.
Thanks Nick
Thanks Gianna.  Americans are smart.  Treating us as otherwise is the problem.  👍
Thanks Demario 👍
Thanks Matt 👍
Would love that 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Kevin
Thanks!
I would issue an Executive Order for the good of Knicks fans everywhere 👍😀🇺🇸
Events generally on Facebook page but will try to give a better sense here too
Back soon!  👍
Thanks Steve!  See you soon.  👍
Thanks Josh 👍😀
Thank you!
Nah
You were one of the first to get behind me and I’ll always appreciate it.
Thank you John!!  👍😀
Freedom Dividend of $1k a month, no private prisons, community policing, body cams, gun safety, legalize marijuana and pardon low-level nonviolent drug offenders, support HBCUs.  But most importantly stop seeing people as economic cogs.  All human.  👍
Want to help for sure.  The problems are deep and longstanding.  Want to work to make them better.
Also record highs - global temperatures.  4 warmest years in recorded history have been the last 4 years.
Thank you Leslie!!!  👍🥊🙏
Those all sound great.  👍 Thanks!
Record highs - suicides, drug overdoses, anxiety, depression, financial insecurity. Record or multi-decade lows - business formation, labor force participation, interstate migration, marriage, childbirths. Life expectancy has declined for 3 years.   We feel sick because we are.
Thanks!
Thanks!!  😀👍
Yes for sure
Thanks!!
Thank you!!
Thanks Adam 👍
Love work
Amazing thanks!
I am into this
Thanks Corey
We have much more to do - but let’s take a moment to celebrate and reflect on what we have just accomplished.  It is unprecedented.  And they haven’t seen anything yet.  😀🇺🇸🎉
Yes.  Thank you!
Thank you Megan 👍
Less than that
Haha thanks Daniel.
Thank you Daniela 😀
Thank you Tim 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Matt 👍😀
Enjoyed the convo Kmele 👍
Thanks James
Would enjoy that 👍
Shout out to my campaign manager @Zach_Graumann - follow him if you want all the dirty laundry of the campaign.  Nah but follow him anyway.  😀 Don’t hold the Duke thing against him.
Thanks!
Thank you - they will get to know me soon.  Appreciate the great work that you do.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks!
Thank you.  Haven’t lived it as much as Tulsi but agree with the need to end the neverending wars.
I’m aggressive on climate 🥊
Like you too Charlotte 😀👍
Thanks for the support!  👍🇺🇸
Appreciate enthusiasm and support a great deal 👍🙏
Working on it 👍
My key commands rusty
I like most of the memes a great deal.  My wife too.
Stay strong 👍❤️🥊
Yes on climate change solutions 👍
America is up for ideas
Thanks Wendy 👍
Thanks for this.  Love it.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Caroline 👍
Thank you!  👍
Do our best to decelerate and geoengineer.  We are only 15% of emissions.
I think Nicolas Cage may have donated to my campaign.  It is done.
Thanks guys 👍🥊
We will get there 👍
Matt Shinners is awesome 👍
Let’s get there 👍
Thanks Joshua 👍
Yes it will
Dems
reached out to twitter and working on it 👍
You know it Misha 👍
Just keep spreading the word.  Thank you!  😀🥊🙏
Changing fast 👍
Thanks Glynna

Don’t think we are either.  Gradual process.  But it is coming.

Thank you Matt!  👍
Thank you Matt!  👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  😀👍
Thanks for catching time zone bug!  👍😀
Thank you!
Thanks Nate. @realDonaldTrump won’t be in office to cover for Dana forever. Open question whether @ConanOBrien @serenawilliams @adamlevine @BenAffleck realize that @WME dragged them into an investment that relies on Dana firing @LeslieSmith_GF and Trump squashing fighter rights
I like that too Jon.
The shame of it is that a union would be better for the sport long-term. Would draw better athletes. Better pipeline. More mainstream stars. Easier to watch with a clear conscience.
He’s in a tough spot.  So are the fighters.  That’s sort of the point.
Been following you for a long time and appreciate your awesome coverage.  Looked forward to your weekly chat for a long time.
You don’t know how long I’ve cared about MMA Ariel.  And you are clearly not the bad guy here.  Just saying it’s going to be tough under ESPN.  I remember them firing Bill Simmons for messing with the NFL.  The relationship is too new for someone to question the fundamentals.
Hate the penny 👍
Thanks Tim 👍
Nah
Ask @LeslieSmith_GF @IamRagin @ALIAQUINTA
Ariel Helwani probably can’t touch this because he works for @espn the @ufc new broadcast partner.  Too bad he seems like he knows the score.  How can you hang out with the fighters and not.
No.
NBA NFL NHL MLB all in the same place.  Want to be a major sport got to walk the walk.
Hence VAT as most effective way forward
The most disorienting thing about running for President is that good images become a deliverable.  Not exactly leadership principle #1.
Definitely
Thanks Peter 👍🇺🇸
Putting buying power into our hands will give rise to a whole new set of opportunities. It will lead to unprecedented levels of entrepreneurship, creativity and caregiving.  We can make the economy work for us instead of being inputs into a machine.
The dynamics of the winner-take-all economy are only accelerating.  Reversing them will take policies that seem dramatic but have the potential to actually move us forward. We need to start trusting people and not institutions.
Studies have shown that even the winners are unhappier in unequal societies.  Higher levels of distrust, suspicion and alienation.  Inequality is bad for everyone.  And inequality is at record highs in the US.
It’s clear that a robust middle class helps people at every level.  Strong consumers mean strong businesses.  Money in consumers’ hands would circulate several times throughout the economy and generate accessible jobs.
Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. We should put more buying power into people’s hands. Part of this is increasing tax rates at the top to be more progressive. The Freedom Dividend and a VAT to harness the gains from new innovations would lead to a Trickle-Up economy.
Thanks Joey
Thanks will do!  😀👍
Thanks Lauren
Will try
57,133!  How did that happen so fast?  A wave is coming and picking up power every day.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Erica.  Freedom Dividend would at least start to compensate caregivers for work they do every day keeping us strong and whole. 👍
Thank you.  👍🙏 Appreciate your spreading the word.
Thank you Usman 👍
Thanks Sri - great meeting you tonight 👍🇺🇸
Thank you!
Thank you Khalil 👍
Thanks a Frank!  Let me know how the movie is.  😀
Thank you 👍
Just keep doing what we are doing, execute and grow.  The news will come.
Data as property right for individuals - companies that profit from our data should pay us.

Making the debate stage in September may require higher number.  Going to compete the whole way.  👍
Thanks all - working on a public schedule. Facebook best place for now.  👍
Yes 👍
Unenforceable to appropriate others’ UBI.
Tech has gone from being deified to villainized in record time. They have historically been immune from regulation because no one in government understood tech. The next step is to curb and address abuses and excesses. I know enough techies to believe they would be open to this.
Another issue is how we get information. Does fragmenting the social media apps solve the fake news problem or help bring us into a common set of facts? Unclear that it does. We need a nuanced approach to big tech with a different toolkit than we have historically used.
One big issue is acquisitions. The current business plan for startups is to get acquired by one of the behemoths. This is what is truly consolidating power and innovation in certain companies.
Sometimes tech companies should indeed be forced to divest parts of their businesses.  Shouldn’t control both distribution and then sell your own wares at an advantage like Amazon does.
Agree there are fundamental issues with big tech. But we need to expand our toolset. For example, we should share in the profits from the use of our data. Better than simply regulating. Need a new legal regime that doesn’t rely on consumer prices for anti-trust.
Agree on this.  👍
Positive on blockchain
Wow thanks!  👍
Sorry Kevin be back soon 👍
Thanks 👍
The temptation is to think that breaking up tech companies will restore Main Street businesses. It won’t. We need to think much bigger about how to address the problems of the 21st century economy. Sharing the gains from new innovations is the place to start.
Thank you Bryan 👍
Thanks Diego
I’m a Marianne Williamson fan.  👍
Thanks Timothy
Actually not a venture capitalist.  Started non-profit fellowship modeled after Teach for America.
Thank you Lacey!!  You all are amazing.  Will come to Atlanta soon!!  😀👍
Thanks Sam 👍
Arguing about versions of UBI strikes me as unproductive when there is one version on the table.  My two cents.
Thank you Karim!
You should know that your work has had an impact on me and my thinking.  You open minds.  Let’s try to do the same for more people.
Hello Stephanie.  Respect your work a great deal.  Disagree that getting ~$2 trillion into the hands of everyday working Americans is snake oil.  We may disagree on mechanisms but please try to see when people’s goals are largely aligned.  Thank you.  👍
Great will send shortly.  Thanks Dax!  👍
The fact is what I’m recommending is a greater economic transfer of resources toward people and families than anything else remotely in the table.  Please weigh the actual impacts and numbers.  Thank you.  👍
Not removing anything.  Supplementing existing programs with an additional $1.8 trillion in human hands. Would make millions of families stronger and healthier.
Thank you - let’s do it.  👍
Liked you since Punk’d back in the day.  😀
There is no removal of any safety net.
Why does the reasoning matter if we are discussing abolishing poverty?
No but I want to.  Mike agree with your perspective and want to help.  Different forms of school and work are needed for both people and society.
Ha thanks
Hey Dax.  I respect the politics-free zone.  Would love to send you a copy of my book and you can have some other folks on if the ideas are of interest.  👍  Keep talking sense and congrats.
Please dig more deeply into both proposal and facts behind it.  Thank you and keep up your great work.  👍🇺🇸
Multiple reasons to support UBI.  Completely dissimilar from Murray proposal which kept spending constant. I’m proposing 2x+ increase. Labor participation rate now at 63.2% near multi-decade low. New jobs are for different people in different places with different skills.
Make things better 👍
Thanks will check it out
Thanks Shawn 👍
Thanks!  👍
Thanks 👍
I’ll come back anytime you all want.  😀👍
Thank you!!
Thanks Sara! 😀
This would be a very dumb way to do that.  👍😀
Thank you 👍
Thanks Angela.  👍
Thank you.  👍
Thank you Charlemagne.  Enjoyed the time together a great deal.  👍
Possibly.  Would catch non-trolls too though.
Thank you Ja’Mal 👍🙏
Thanks Adam.  Appreciate the support a great deal.  😀👍🇺🇸
Thanks Corbin 👍
👍
Thanks Michael
Thanks Matty.  Will do.  👍
I say yes
Yes
Appreciate every bit
Their prerogative 👍 thank you
Thanks Matt 👍
The first step is seeing if someone wants to work with you. The second step is leaving the door open. Generally those are the only two steps.
Thanks Dan!  👍😀🇺🇸
When words and numbers collide the numbers generally win.
Thanks Max 👍
Thank you Frank 👍
Thanks tell my wife
Thanks Parry 👍
People with money tend to be visible.  People without money tend to be invisible. That distorts who and what we see.
“Excuse me - are you that guy running for President?”  Been getting that a lot lately.
Long 5-count for King Kong Bundy.  RIP.
Ranked choice voting 👍
Thanks Natasha!  😀👍
Me too
51,618.  That was fast.  Raised over $175k in March ALREADY.  We are actually picking up momentum!  Thank you for making it happen.  🙏😀
Not like you fear.  And it’s not ethics it’s price sensitivity and competition among firms.
Great to hear it 👍
Thanks!  I like you too.  😀👍
Thanks!  Enjoyed it a great deal.
Thanks David
Thank you
Thanks!  👍😀
Thanks Prince 👍
Also helps with enabling women to improve their situations and avoid abuse or harassment, communities of color accessing better opportunities and many other social issues.
It is much easier to modify our capital flows than it is to upgrade complex systems and bureaucracies.    If we get the money right many other systems will improve:  people will be stronger, healthier, better educated, mentally healthier, and more entrepreneurial and creative.
Thanks Joe 👍
Enjoyed the convo a great deal 👍
Thank you Carrie!  😀👍
Going to help.  Clean up bureaucracy and make $1k a month immediately available.
49,765.  Appreciate every one.  Steps towards history.  😀👍🇺🇸
Yes
The American People are a Sleeping Giant.  And we are Waking Up.
Against both
Thank you Jennifer!!  🙏👍
It’ll be up soon 👍😀
I’m a reasonable man.
Thank you 👍
The stats on retraining are dismal.  More wish than policy.
Thanks Alexis!!
Thank you!!
Thank you 👍🙏

Thanks Joel.  Keep your relationships strong.  👍❤️
Thanks Paul
Thanks for making an exception Garry 👍
Thanks Brett
Invest in teams and give them room to run.  Care about people.  Set clear goals.
Thanks Annie
I have started and run multimillion-dollar organizations.  This feels familiar.  👍
1.  Don’t know.  2.  No to campaign 👍
Would you believe that we are at $132k+ in donations in March already?  And the month is young.  😀👍
Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen - and they haven’t seen anything yet.  😀👍
Art ought to pay better.
I like it
The people have spoken 👍
To bring the country together I would give everyone an HBO GO password so we could all watch Game of Thrones.

Nah doesn’t work that way fortunately
Thank you Ty!  You and yours are a class act.  👍🇺🇸
There should be an MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference every year for social problems.
This is why so many admire Mike Bloomberg.  Smart, effective leader.  Hope to work with him to solve the big problems.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks.  Have experience in things I think would be helpful.  👍
Thank you!!

Always listening 👍
Thank you!
Man the guns issue is tough.  I know that people feel very strongly in both sides.  I believe there are good things we can get done that don’t impinge on gun owners’ lawful rights.
I live in a world where if I put my mind and heart into something I can make good things happen.  That makes me very lucky.  I appreciate it every day.
Thank you Chelsea!  👍
Thanks Patrick
Not really.  Data very positive in most dimensions.
Thanks Ernabel.  We can do much better than that for new moms and parents.  👍
“We are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity . . . the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining.” - Stephen Hawking

Thanks Alexis 👍🥊
This is messed up.  We are the richest most advanced country in the history of the world.  We can do much better than this.  As a parent I’m angry on behalf of you and your kids.
RIP Luke Perry.  Touched many lives and gone too soon.
Soon 👍
Always open to new info 👍
Thank you to everyone who made this possible.  We are getting more serious all of the time.  👍
History is instructive.  But we are living in unprecedented times.  We may have to do some new thinking about the problems of the 21st century.
Yes next week 👍
Thanks Sarah
One way to make the transition home easier for military vets - have their qualifications from the armed forces transfer to civilian environments. Vets tell me that hazmat transport and other certifications don’t count when they get home. Experience in the military should count.
Is this a democracy?  Let’s test it out.
Thanks Nicole
Thanks Erika.  😀👍
A mindset of scarcity has a profound effect. Studies have shown that an inability to pay one's bills can reduce functional intelligence by the equivalent of 13 IQ points, almost one full standard deviation. Pervasive financial insecurity may actually be making us dumber.
Thanks for the thoughtful response.  I think reasonable people can come together on common sense approaches.  Most Americans agree that there shouldn’t be absolutes on either side.
Amended to 18+
Thank you Perry!  Thank you family for me too 😀👍

Thank you David.  Let’s make it happen.  👍🇺🇸
Thank you just tweeted 👍
Thank you Andrew 👍🇺🇸🙏
One leads to the other 👍

Great idea
Will be available in store soon 😀👍
Thanks Kara - would enjoy that 👍
Thanks Herbie!!  👍😀🇺🇸

We are being given an historic opportunity to make real changes.  People are ready.  Let’s make the most of it.
Would enjoy that
Thank you 👍
Thanks Joe
I was a busboy at a local Chinese restaurant as a teenager - “The Imperial Wok.”  My English surprised the patrons.  We got paid primarily in tips.  Now I always tip well.

Thanks Jessica.  That is indeed a big deal.  😀👍
Thanks Tom
Thanks David 👍
Robert said he’d come back to Washington with me if I asked 😀👍🇺🇸

Thanks Devin
Thanks Anders.  Doing what comes naturally.  Owe Sam a great deal.  👍
Thank you!  😀👍
Just spread the word Matt.  Thank you!!  👍😀
Need to introduce myself to as many Americans as possible.  Would love invites from other outlets.  👍
My odds get better every day.  😀👍
Quick interview next time
Thanks Todd
Looks like I’m joining the @breakfastclubam next Wednesday morning.  Pumped for it.  👍
The challenge is to become both more dynamic and more empathetic at the same time.
Thank you!!  👍😀
The federal government just announced its first AI initiative. This is overdue but welcome. The real step is putting resources behind it - including billions of dollars for computing resources. The Chinese and others are funding AI development.  We should do the same.
Austin Iowa and San Francisco starting next week
February was the best month yet for our campaign!  The numbers will be newsworthy.  We will shock the world.  👍🥊
Jay Inslee has led the charge on addressing climate change for years.  He is right - this issue will define this century and the world we leave to our children.  So glad he’s in the race - he will move us in the right direction.
I’ve found that being high-commitment is often necessary to get something significant done.
Thank you Linda!
Thanks John 👍
Thank you Scott 👍
Enjoyed it too Ben.  👍
Thanks!
No more age limit
I was very profane as a kid trying to be tough.  In college I gave my friends license to pound on my left arm anytime I swore around them.  I stopped within a week.
We should give ourselves more credit.  What we do is not easy.

Thank you Lilly!
“Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” - folk proverb @JonHaidt
Thanks Alexis - hope you’re doing great.  Sure seems like it.  😀👍
Thanks Scott.  👍
Mostly no.  People and dividend portable and still price sensitive.
Every consumer-facing business would have customers with much greater purchasing power.
Yes slight delay
Thank you 👍
I get emotional about facts.
I believe there are multiple strands - but I think the economic backdrop is crucial myself.  Having worked in the Midwest and the South things are not going well for many many people.
Positive.  I like EITC too.  Prefer Dividend because of universality, timing of payments and administration.
It feels great knowing you’re doing exactly what you’re supposed to be doing.  I want more people to have this feeling.  Let’s do it.
I occasionally think of the other Andrew Yangs out there.  I hope I have their support.  😀
I think things can get worse.  I also think they can get better.  Unfortunately one is the path of least resistance.  The other will require us to fight for it very very hard.  👍🥊🇺🇸
@CNN may be about to catch up 👍
When I’m President I’ll use real numbers 👍
I like the vision and priorities
65k.  Had 15k coming in.  👍
I like Elizabeth Warren.  Have people in common.
Not really
Yes
Sooner
There is nothing stopping the majority of citizens of a democracy from declaring ourselves a dividend.  When people start realizing this we will change the course of history.  It will happen faster than most think possible.
Thanks Brett 👍
Regional inequality and financial insecurity - moving takes resources.  Many can’t move because they are underwater on a mortgage or house that has lost value.
For the Paris Accords, carbon fee and dividend, investing hundreds of billions in more sustainable and resilient infrastructure, and agree that climate change is an existential threat to our way of life and must be addressed as soon as possible.
Sure 👍
Thanks Andrew
Going to be rough - let’s fight for a better future together.  👍
Glad you did 👍
The problem is that we need work - and a lot of work won’t need us.
Thank you for this!  😀🙏
Thank you 👍
Thanks Irshad 👍
Thank you Ling!  😀
Thank you Marianne - excited to be included.  👍🙏
The Freedom Dividend would enhance the dynamism of our society on a staggering scale - more businesses, arts, creativity, migration, risk-taking and innovation.  Imagine how many people have something inside of them they have wanted to share.  We will unleash our own potential.
Thank you Casey 👍😀
Yes coming soon 👍
This campaign has had a mindset of abundance from the beginning.  Thank you for making that abundance real.  👍🙏
Modern
Italian bomb
Modern
Turns out New Haven (a)pizza is special.
Yes if green card.  Bug your citizen friends!  👍
Thank you 👍
31,483.  Almost halfway there with 2-and-a-half months to go!  Our pace is amazing.  😀
Nah former Knicks fan.
LeBron missing the playoffs will feel wrong.
When we make the debate stage in June certain press outlets will have a little bit of explaining to do 👍
It’s .32 😀
No one is coming to fix it.  We are going to have to do it ourselves.
Would immediately fund asteroid detection.
If someone else does better that doesn’t mean you do worse.  It generally means the opposite.
Thanks Susan and Michael 😀👍
Would love that
Thank you Daniel 👍
The secret to entrepreneurship is to tell everyone you know what you are trying to do.  Then you have no choice but to do it.
It’s hard to demonize giving people money.
Heading back to New Hampshire today for a town hall with @WMUR9 - excited for it.
Early adopters are the best.  Thank you.
I have worked with many people from tough backgrounds who are now thriving and performing at world-class levels. If we truly invest in our people we will unlock vast, almost unfathomable levels of human potential.
Nominate away
Yes
Very much for a carbon fee and dividend 👍
Complex question.  Depends on situation, individual, geography, etc.
I ordinarily feel some desire to see the Best Picture winner.  For some reason I don’t feel that this year.
Still getting it updated - should be accurate soon 👍
Think you’re safe
Sure.  Hi.  👍😀
Our campaign traffic, volunteers, follows, press requests and donations are all at record highs and increasing. Every indicator is heading way up to the right. As a numbers guy I can tell you this campaign is taking off. Thank you.  Let’s show what we can do.  🙏🇺🇸🥊
Not suggesting we do.  Our capital flows are MUCH easier to modify than our energy infrastructure.  One will accelerate the other.
First we get the economic boot off of everyone’s throats. Then when people are thinking a bit more clearly we tackle climate change. It’s hard to get folks who are struggling to make ends meet to focus on big societal problems. First activate abundance. Then we can advance.
Thanks Joel 👍
Thank you!!  👍
There are so many people struggling in America today.  It becomes obvious as soon as you start to look.
Yes I do.  Great fan of the potential of blockchain.  👍
Most people who think we can turn coal miners into coders are neither.
Agree would not solve the problem
Thanks Brad.  Trying to let people know what is coming.
Technology is fundamentally changing many aspects of American life.  Meanwhile many of our legislators don’t understand how Facebook works much less the impact of AI and automation on the economy.  We need to catch up to the true challenges of the 21st century.
Thanks @SmithInAmerica 👍
Looking forward to it Gillian 👍
Bug an American friend 😀🇺🇸
Yes very much so
Not sure would love this stat too
Thanks Annie
Broadly
Yes I did 😀
Thank you!!  👍😀
@lessig 👍
One reason we sometimes wind up with extreme politicians is that we have a one-round process that does not always reflect people’s true preferences. Ranked choice voting would help reward candidates who command broad support and would lead to better results. The process matters.
Don’t disagree.  Saw limits.  One reason I am going a different direction now.  We need to think much bigger than most investors would allow.
Look closer at my background.  Founded non-profit to help Detroit, New Orleans, etc.  👍
Thanks Andre.  Happy for these ideas to be front and center.
For data as a property right.  Agree.
That wasn’t UBI
With AI we should be able to cut the expense structure of the federal government in particular.  Businesses are about to take advantage of epic efficiencies.  We should try to have our government do the same.
Sorry Adam
One thing I love about this campaign is that it is all upside and growth.  I don’t have a political reputation to preserve.  This is a high variance campaign with the chance to change the world.  Thank you for seeing its potential.  Let’s achieve it.
Thanks for getting me here!  👍😀
Yes said the DNC reached out to my team.  Still need to hit the thresholds which we will 👍
Thanks Adam 👍
Thank you!  👍
Ah the Patriots.
Thank you
Many smart people at Cleveland Clinic, Mayo, etc.
Thank you 👍
Will try and get there
Thanks Matt
Thank you!  Fan of Marianne’s too.  😀👍
Thank you!!
Thank you Amy!
Thank you!
Unique people.  Tell friends!
Thanks Wilson
Thanks Claire!
Thanks Charlie
Love ranked choice voting 👍
Great spending time with you Tim
No they reached out separately.  Still need to earn that spot.
They reached out but we still need to hit the thresholds to make the debates!  👍
Thank you Sandra 👍
Still competition between firms and cost sensitivity in every category
Thanks Jess!
Thanks Jordyn
Not really happily
Thank you 👍
Unfortunately no.  🤨 Tell a friend!  😀
Oh yeah
Thanks Jon.  Shea I’m a fan of yours from the Ringer.  👍
Thank you Carlos!!  👍😀
Thanks Steven
This upcoming year will be the most exciting and important work I have ever done.  Thank you for that.  👍🇺🇸🥊
@spidadmitchell I hear you
Sets a tone - okay to exploit young people for financial gain
Minimum a share of jersey and memorabilia sales
No just humans
Thanks Michael
Don’t actually
Coming soon Feb 27
Yes
Supplement for those getting lower benefits
Thanks Ben 👍
Thanks Jonny.  Judiciously.  🇺🇸👍
Thanks Jim
Nah just need to get a lot done while my brain is good 😀
Sometimes a journalist will say to me “You’re polling at 1%” as if it’s a bad thing.  I respond, “That’s right.  And that’s when most Americans have never heard of me.  We are only going to grow from here.”
Thanks Preston
Not yet hope to soon
On pace but need to keep going 👍😀
Thank you!
Thank you Steve 👍🇺🇸
Thanks for having me Bill!  👍🇺🇸
Hello Hanna!  😀
Thanks Laura!  👍
Thanks Benny 👍
We may be required to do fantastic things
Thank you Claire 👍
Thanks Pierce.
US antitrust laws are hopelessly out of date. They are designed to prohibit price gouging due to monopoly power. Today’s tech giants would never dream of gouging. Instead they price others out of the market and consolidate. The consumer wins but many lose. We need new approaches.
Thanks Kate!
Thanks Alexis
Thanks Nick
Thanks Mark
Meeting with the Guardian, CBS and the Wall St Journal today.  People are catching on.  👍🇺🇸
Thank you John 👍🇺🇸
When I am President I will appoint a Head of Culture to congratulate sports teams, pardon turkeys and handle other ceremonial duties.  Most Americans would rather meet the Rock, Oprah or Joe Rogan than me anyway.  😀 Everyone wins.
Thanks 👍
Thanks David!  👍
Bernie Sanders has inspired millions of people and transformed our politics.  I was an admirer and still am.  I’m glad he’s running as I’m sure his work will continue to move us all in the right direction.
Thanks Nathan
Thank you Charlotte - appreciate this and the amazing work that you do!  😀👍🙏
Thanks Adriel.  The right people can overcome many things.  👍
Georgetown University I’ll be speaking at Lohrfink Auditorium in the Rafik Hariri Building at 7 pm on Tuesday as part of the Presidential Lecture Series.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  👍
Thanks Nathan 😀
Thanks Bing 👍
Soon 👍
More buying power equals more competition for our business - we will still be price sensitive
Thank you!
Thanks Charlotte- great to meet you tonight.  Congrats on the work that you do.  👍🙏
Thanks Calle
Anand let’s do it
Thanks Brett.  👍
Thanks Ashley 👍
Would put a stop to the abuses in immigrant communities 👍.  As the son of immigrants I get it.
You can but it only counts once.  Tell your friends!  👍
A mindset of abundance - and many incredible supporters - have taken this campaign very far.  And we are only getting started.
For ranked choice
Thank you!!
Big Trekkie myself TNG 👍
Yes that’s an issue.  We can enforce to make sure there isn’t that imbalance.
Thanks Ralph
Thanks Isaac
Thank you Annie 👍🇺🇸
Amazon could pay taxes without passing it all on to consumers.  Companies do it all the time.
It adjusts for inflation over time.  People will still be cost sensitive and there will still be competition between firms (I.e. Samsung and Google vs Apple in your example)
Just once 😀
Thanks Matteo.  Means a lot.
Thanks Joel!  👍
Thanks Alex!  👍😀
Thank you 👍
Yes it does 👍
Thank you!!  👍
Thank you!!  😀👍
So glad for you and your family!!  That’s a wonderful story - and one I’ve heard before.  Holistic approaches can work wonders.  😀👍🎉
Thank you!  👍😀
6:24 EST.  I have children.
Thanks for the support Mia!  😀
Thanks Ryan
Thanks Bob - Venture for America may be a bit different than you think.  Nonprofit entrepreneurship fellowship with emphasis on non-coastal cities (Detroit, Cleveland, etc)
Man Cain looked terrible.
Glad to be there John 👍
Thank you Chris
Thank you Jamie 👍
Thanks Rob 👍🇺🇸
Little known fact about me - I was on the US National Debate Team in 1992 that went to the World Championships in London.  If you get me on that debate stage I will deliver.  👍
Ha thanks.  Donnie Yen!
Don’t think so
Thanks Mia.  Didn’t mean to be negative.  Have read some of these books and enjoyed them.  More against the rituals and forms than any specific work.
Thanks Tom 🙏
I say yes to most legit press invites.
No such thing come on by 😀
Thanks Scott!
Yes I did Mitch
Thank you Ryan!
Thanks Josh
Thanks Jake - coming back your way soon 👍😀

I’m a fan of holistic medicine.
Thanks Chuck!
Thanks George!
Thanks Tony!
This is true too 👍
Just wrapped up interview with @PeteHegseth - enjoyed it.  Thanks Pete.
Thanks Marianne.  There is a reason we are disintegrating.  Let’s fight for the future.  👍🇺🇸
Big challenge.  Bring in the right people.  Cut the red tape where helpful.
5k closer than we were a couple days ago 👍
Yes in NY
Thanks Katrina
We were definitely both campaigning 😀
Bringing Scott with me for sure 😀👍
No one will see this revolution coming.  The revolution of reason.
Thanks Robin

Yes

Thanks - hope you enjoy it.  🙏

I’ve got a plan for each
Thanks Nathan
New tax on big winners of the new economy
Thanks!
I’m my own man 👍
Thanks Jacob
Thanks Nate 👍😀
Thanks Luis
Yes that counts 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Scott
Thanks Frank
Thanks Bryan 👍
Thanks Scott
We are pretty good about that.  👍
Thanks Dave
Thanks Arjan
Thank you!
Thanks!
Yes but only counts once.  😀
Thank you!
Citizens or green card holders.  Bug your American friends.  😀
Yes.  Forgive debt.  Grant statehood if that’s what they want.  Rebuild.  Make it a national project.  I got married there.  They are Americans and we should act like it.
Met a teenager from West Branch, Iowa whose entire town was devastated by the shutdown because they rely upon people visiting the Herbert Hoover library and the nearby national park - both of which were closed for a month.  They are still recovering. 1 month’s pay tough to miss.
Thanks Brad 👍
Thanks Ashley 👍
Thanks Tim
Thanks Bennet 👍🇺🇸
Thank you!  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Jennifer
I am so pumped to have concrete goals for us to hit by May 15th.  We are going to operate and hit that debate stage in June.
I think any amount counts!  👍🇺🇸
Thanks!
Thank you!
Thanks Patrick!
Thanks!
Thank you
Thanks Ernesto 😀
Grows every day - we will get there.  Have 3 months!
It’s self-defense.  Will change if people see it in action and as possible.  👍
Thanks Kyle
Need to evolve quickly
Forgive much of student loan debt as economic stimulus
Thanks Tony
Thanks Patrick
Mild if markets allowed to function properly
Thanks Conan
Thanks Bruce
Thanks Daniel
Happy Valentine’s Day!  I really didn’t like this holiday as a kid.  Always made me feel self-conscious.  Now that I’m married it’s . . .  a little bit better.  😀❤️
Thanks Zach
Not touching existing welfare programs - Freedom Dividend opt-in
Tax on those who win the most in new economy
Not taking anyone’s welfare away
Hope to be there soon 👍
Thanks Scott
Positive on individual level not widespread enough to judge economic impact
Thanks Brittany 😀👍
Income mobile.  Easier to move.  Easier to cohabitate pool income etc.
Feel for the guy.  We can do better than this.
Hard to believe how far this campaign has come.  Incredible things are still possible.
Thanks Scott.  Learned a lot from you.
Wouldn’t have happened without you Sam 🙏
For universal healthcare 👍
Thank you 👍
Still the case.  Sometimes use UBI as a general term.
Freedom Dividend
Thank you
Getting lots of new supporters today.  Thank you - let’s show what we can do.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Derek
Thank you 👍
Thanks Ashish
Thanks Robert
Understand Matt and appreciate your consideration and open-mindedness.
Thanks Kevin
Thanks Robert
Thanks Niles
Thanks David
Thanks Erik 👍
Thank you.  Let’s do it.  👍
For detecting asteroids that could hit earth.  Should have done that already.  Support other efforts.  👍
No reason I can’t be
Thanks Cody 👍
Thanks Randy
The @DNC has invited my campaign in to meet - good sign for making the debates in June.  👍🇺🇸  Let’s keep putting numbers on the board.
Amended to include seniors 👍
Thank you for the thoughtful reporting Sarah.  👍
Thanks Miles
I’m a fan 👍
Thank you Tiffany 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Neil
Heading West for interview with @joerogan tomorrow at 3 pm EST.  Been looking forward to this for quite a while.  👍🥊😀
Thanks Renita
A lot of people listened to @Freakonomics on @NPR this weekend - glad public radio still alive and well 👍😀.
Thanks Rebecca 👍
Need to strengthen SS and apply a floor
Both Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren seem like phenomenal leaders who have fought to improve people’s lives for years.  I’m looking forward to meeting them in the days ahead.
Thank you 👍🇺🇸
Sorry to miss you Zach.  See you soon.  👍
Thanks Eric 👍🇺🇸
The campaign car is a Chevy 👍🇺🇸
Some candidates take a private jet back from New Hampshire.  Some take a Subaru.
Great let’s take it all the way
Thank you 👍🇺🇸
Podcasts really transform the driving experience.
Thanks Dallas.  Spread the word and we can do it 👍🙏
Thank you 👍🇺🇸
I feel like I’m doing exactly what I’m supposed to be doing.  Thank you for making that so.  👍
Thanks Solange 👍
Thanks Barbara 👍
Thank you Joy 👍🙏
Favorable
The NBA seems much less interesting after the trade deadline.
Thanks Rick 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Lauren 👍😀
Hello Alexandria - would love to connect soon.  👍🇺🇸
Postponed 🤨
There are many times when running for President is a lot of fun.  😀
People will be much more mobile and communal living arrangements will pick up.  Still competition for tenants.
Went to law school and was on law review at Columbia.  Started an economic development organization that received grants from state governments.  If you dig into my background it may surprise you.
Trump is not an entrepreneur - more of a marketing charlatan.  Gives real builders a bad name.  People can tell the difference.
Thank you Carlos - great to be with you today 👍🇺🇸
Thanks @SCJBretH
Yes soon
Howard Schultz should just say “V1 has failed.”
Thanks Daniel 👍
No
Am I the only one who now finds State of the Union addresses increasingly bizarre and unwatchable?  My alternative version coming later tonight.  Am campaigning in New Hampshire trying to get this guy out of there.
Of course!  👍
Distributes gains to allow more to do the work that they want
Yeah we have to make it easier for people to leave Congress without lobbying
Thanks Mona 👍
Yes
For it and will push it
Nope 👍
Filmed segment 👍
Darn.
A lot of ads that seem to suggest robot anxiety.  It’s in the culture now.  People are catching on.
Don’t let them distract us.  Focus on the money.
We know it is wildly popular and that a majority of Alaskans - a deeply conservative state - said they would approve of higher taxes to retain the dividend.
Someone suggested that we make the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday.  That seems a bit much to me.  First Election Day.  Then Revenue Day.
My brother is a huge Patriots fan.  I . . . am not.  The Super Bowl tonight will make one of us very happy.
Most people have no idea what they’re capable of.  We need more of us to find out.
Thanks Pat.  Trying to get a better sense of what the future holds for truckers with self-driving trucks - and what they think it holds.
Thanks Dean.  Only way I know how.
Thanks Travis 👍
Thanks Erik
To the extent that the US can help restore stability and provide aid to the people of Venezuela we should.  My heart goes out to the Venezuelan people who are suffering due to failed leadership over a period of years.
Venezuela is on the verge of becoming a failed state. Sanctions - which would hurt the people- aren’t helpful nor is talk of military intervention. The goal should be free and fair elections and Venezuelan self-determination. The US should not be in the business of regime change.
Yes.  They are Americans.  👍
Thanks Joey.  Alyssa congrats on all you do for the country.  Let me know if there’s anything I can do 👍🇺🇸
Thanks @dpakman
Get a crowd together the same time as SXSW 👍
On my way be a bit late
Welcome aboard Alison!  👍😀🇺🇸
I have known Cory Booker since he ran for mayor of Newark.  He has set a powerful example of service over the years.  It seemed like a presidential run was always in his future - glad the future is now.  Look forward to seeing him on the trail.
Thank you Mary.  👍
Unless the Knicks have a back channel deal with Kevin Durant and Kyrie this trade is the worst thing I have ever seen.
Thanks Jason
Kristaps is concerned about the Knicks.  He has eyes.
Thanks Dave.  Let’s make the case to our fellow Americans that we can solve the real problems.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Be there in 2
For it.
Thanks Tim.  @rcbregman
Heading West to Ames.  Prairie Lights on March 13th.  👍
Of course Wayne 👍
Not judging anyone.  Not saying people can’t run and win.
I like Bernie.  Not saying people can’t run or win.
Lower stakes
There is a minimum age to be President in the Constitution. We should look at a maximum age as well or at least have candidates go through rigorous physical and mental health screenings. We had at least one President on shaky mental ground due to age-related causes. Maybe more.
“What does it feel like to be in Iowa on the second coldest day in state history?”  Memorable.
Definitely
Thank you Topher - with people like you behind me this campaign will go very very far 👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Phil.  Hello Matt - big fan of your work.  Agree we should relocate some agencies to the Midwest.  Would love to connect.  👍🇺🇸
Thought @ericgarcetti would run for sure - he has a keen sense of the future. Good for LA.
Great to hear it Alana!!  😀👍  I love the Catskills.
It’s better than you think.  Ran a non-profit and get it.  👍
Look up The Great Purple Ride if you want to take the tour 👍
Thanks Will.  Let’s solve the problems as fast as we can.
Everyone gets $1k minimum.  If you are getting less you get trued up.  Unconditionally.
Goal is to provide floor for everyone - would not touch disability which many rely on.
Would not touch disability checks- goal is to provide floor for everyone.  👍
Would enjoy that
Thanks Joey
I like @marwilliamson’s message of humanism a great deal.  She is right about the despair in our country - financial insecurity, depression, suicides, addiction all at record highs.  I hope to meet her soon on the trail.
Glad you enjoyed it Matt 👍😀
Hope to get back there soon
Making 8th trips to Iowa and New Hampshire this week and next including speaking at my old high school in Exeter.  Iowa and New Hampshire are like my boys - I love them both equally.  Unless polling indicates I should spend more time in one than another.
Up to voters what sort of experience they value.  Beauty of democracy.  👍🇺🇸
Was appointee under President Obama.  Named to National Advisory Council also under Obama.  Led non-profit for 7 years.  Went to law school and passed the bar.  My experience may not be what you think.
Thanks Chloe.  Jake we met at CGI Americas.  Would be glad to reconnect.  👍🇺🇸
Working on it!  Looks like April.
Thanks Ashe 👍
Thank you Omid 👍
Thanks Dylan and Mike.  Dylan happy to connect.  👍🇺🇸
Read Anand’s book and agree with it.   We need to broaden our definitions of worth and value very quickly.
I’m in.  They’ve had a good run.
Anthony Davis wants out. Biggest trade in NBA history forthcoming. Dark horse - Nets.
Single payer
Can appreciate others and win Ricky.  👍😀🥊
Will do
Very glad @KamalaHarris is in the presidential race. She will inspire many people and I agree with many of her legislative priorities. Her tax plan approaches Universal Basic Income - wish she would go all the way. But thrilled she will be making the case for new priorities.
I have met @HowardSchultz several times. He struck me as a good man and patriot though we see things very differently. It is unfortunate that our electoral system makes independent bids so fraught and likely to result in a potentially disastrous outcome. Ranked choice would help.
Stick with me - we will make you look prescient in a little while.  😀👍
Yes
Basic Income increases purchasing power for vast majority - that’s where the VAT is going.  Regressive only without basic income 👍
Would definitely look at it and would support electoral reform 👍
Goal is to provide a floor for everyone.  Appreciate the passion and support a great deal.  Lack of conditions and administration would be a huge relief for many.  Would also improve lives of family members who may not be on programs.
Thanks Travis
Underemployment rate of college grads is 44% and average debt up to $38k totaling $1.5 trillion.  Only 32% go to college.  Money better.
Yes
I like it.  Journalism vouchers.
Thanks for telling it like it is Kevin.  👍
Done
Thanks Megan 👍🇺🇸
Thanks for leading on this Lawrence.  Let’s get our democracy back.  👍🇺🇸🥊
The Nets have had no draft picks and are good.  The Knicks have had their draft picks and are bad.  Shows what good management can do.
Thanks Paula. Will be greatest catalyst for arts and creativity we have ever seen.  😀👍
Talked to BBC and they make it work
We accomplished nothing but at least people were hurt in the process.
Not going anywhere 😀
Looks like the government is reopening.  Thrilled for the workers and people impacted - this shutdown was ridiculous and never should have happened in the first place.
Thank you.  In my view Universal Basic Income is a big step toward addressing climate change - encourages minimalism and communal living and replaces a mindset of scarcity with a mindset of abundance and future-orientation.  👍
Brits do it with BBC.
Philanthropy at this point equals tech money (Time, Atlantic Washington Post, etc).
Thank you!  😀👍
Yes!  Ohio soon
Thank you 😀👍🥊
Thank you Bryant 👍🙏🇺🇸
You had better vote for me and get some swag 👍😀
I admire Bernie a great deal and feel he and I are aligned on the main concerns - improving the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.  👍🇺🇸
This campaign is the opposite of Fyre Festival.
New Hampshire voters know a phony when they see one.  👍🇺🇸
Coming back soon 👍 Next 2 weeks
UBI by the math reduces inequality.  Already does so in Alaska.
This is best first step toward an economy that serves people. The problems have been building up for decades unfortunately. This is the most direct way to help and put us in position to solve the long-term problems and improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans.
Have been CEO of a private company that was acquired for millions and head of a multimillion dollar non-profit organization that I started.  For a dreamer I am very practical.
Thanks Syd!  👍😀
Yes shortly 👍🇺🇸
Started a non-profit that helped create thousands of jobs in Detroit Cleveland New Orleans and other cities.  My background may not be what you believe.
At this point just expressing a vision of the future is preferable to sitting it out.  😀
Well at least I get to root against the Patriots in the Superbowl.
This game is something else.
Feeling Chiefs vs. Saints in the Superbowl.
I think you know
For this
This campaign grows every day thanks to you all.  Thank you.  👍🇺🇸🥊🙏
Thanks Adam
Thanks SK 👍
This Warriors team is too good.  Takes the air out of the season.
More affordable than that.  Unlike in Iraq the money doesn’t disappear.  Grows the economy.
Update to GDP that measures health, affordability, mental health, childhood success, etc.  Better measurements would drive very different behavior.  👍
So grateful to my campaign team - imagine having people whose job it is to make you look good for the world.  👍😀  I joke that they probably see my face or hear my voice when they go to sleep.  Their selflessness and dedication inspires me.  #humanity
Every child being assured of $1k a month when they become 18 is a game changer for parents.  👍
His game fits better with Doncic.  Defends.  Lots of steals.
Will do.
Dennis Smith Jr. for Frank Ntilikina.  Right a wrong.
Who knew @buzzfeed might make history.  🇺🇸
Why is the first UFC card on ESPN such a dud?  Odd.
Thanks Jennifer!!  👍😀
Thanks Jodi.  Me too!  👍😀
Thanks Morgan 👍
Zero sum thinking is appropriate in some situations, unhelpful in others.  Applied societywide - or in negotiating a government shutdown- it’s a complete disaster.
Plan includes all adults including seniors 👍
Hearing that some people I expected to run may not do so. Going to be fascinating.
Who would you want to work with in the trench 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Siegrid
Thanks Tim.  Look forward to sharing the journey ahead.  👍😀🇺🇸
I love progress and automation.  I don’t love an economic system that will increasingly marginalize people. Pushing for evolution so we can properly celebrate progress.
Thanks Chelsea 👍
VAT at half the European level + economic growth + cost savings + value gains is more than $1 trillion
Thanks Kristina
Thanks Michael
Thank you.  Let’s show what the humans can do.  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Adam and John.  Would be pleased to connect.  I think we may surprise you.  👍
Thanks Chris.  Will get there.  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Eli 👍
Nate @NateSilver538 has been ignoring me even though @perrybaconjr of @538politics has not.  A bit confusing.
For that too.
Trying to prove you right that humans are up to this challenge 👍
Thanks Aidan!  Great catch.  @KaBloom214 @BrianPBosche so proud of you guys!!  :)
Congrats @danbloom1 @BrianBosche for building a great company and solving problems with @GoSlope. You are still just getting started.  @venture4america 👍🇺🇸😀
Be glad to send you a copy Elena 👍
At this point even Republicans wish @JDScholten had beaten Steve King.
Cash much better.  Government’s ability to efficiently manage large scale jobs organizations dubious at best based upon examples past and present.  Better to put buying power into economy and generate new opportunities from ground up.
Thank you Jennifer!  Coming to MN soon 👍
Thanks Zoe 😀🇺🇸
I get asked all of the time "How do you overcome the corporate interests?"  It shows people understand that this is about making our communities stronger.  But even CEOs know that their companies will be better off if people have money to spend. This is the future of capitalism.
Agree that both are necessary.  👍
NY Jets.  Sigh.
Thanks Cecilia!!  😀
Thanks Lizelle 😀👍🇺🇸
Haha it’s true Niki
They’ll probably do a 2nd story 👍
Thanks Kenny!  👍😀🙏
Thanks Scott 🙏
Thanks Joe.  I’ll be in Boston soon if you are around then.  Would love to meet and maybe have you say something at an event.  I’m now a fan of your work.  😀
Thank you!  👍😀
My brother is a Pats fan.  He lived in Boston.  Go figure.
People in New Hampshire will understand sports loyalty and not pandering.  👍🇺🇸
All I want for my birthday is for the Patriots to lose.
Thanks Josh!  👍😀
Thanks Jamie!
Thank you!  😀
Thanks John!
Thank you Katie!!!  🙏👍😀
Thanks Carlos!!  👍😀🇺🇸🎉
No
Thanks Medvis 👍😀
Thank you Steven
Thanks Luis.  Appreciate your calling it out and see where you are coming from.  My values and perspective are not the same as Tucker’s on many many fronts.  My parents are immigrants.
Though we invented this economic system it now has a life of its own.  We need to rewrite the rules as fast as possible.  It will not be easy.  But we really don’t have a choice.  AI is about to change the game.  We are in a race.  We have to make it one that people can win.
Thanks Paul
Just pointing out that AI and the technological displacement of workers is hitting the radar in different quarters.
Pointing out that someone is talking about AI and automation as a massive job destroyer is just saying that the topic is gaining currency everywhere.
Thank you Jennifer 👍😀
.@juliancastro did great things for San Antonio and I have no doubt will do the same for people across America.  A real patriot, great values and inspirational story.
Progressives like it because it channels resources to people.  Conservatives like it because it channels resources to states on the interior and rural areas. Just need a majority.  Very achievable.
Thanks Carlos.  See you soon.  👍🇺🇸
I’m totally running.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Dustin
Thanks Brian
Spread the word Joe 👍😀🇺🇸
The list of countries without paid leave for new mothers: Lesotho, Swaziland, Papua New Guinea and the US. We are ridiculously anti-women and family in an incredibly shortsighted way. It’s much better for both capital efficiency and humanity for moms to spend time with their kids
Thank you Danielle Barboza of Massachusetts, Michael Alboroto of Hawaii and Ray Le of California for donating today!  You all are the best.  👍😀🇺🇸
Nothing like running for President to make you seem young.
Thank you!
It is produced in a central bank.  Sometimes digitally.  $4 trillion for banks.  $1.5 trillion for Corps.  Depends who you are.
Over a thousand new followers today - guess @freakonomics quite popular 😀👍
Every other major economy already has a VAT.  #1 market.
We took a look at it and it turns out a significant proportion of politicians’ social media followers are not real (I.e. lots of bots).  Not sure why that is.
Thanks Joe
Thank you 👍😀❤️
Thanks Ashley!  Hope you are great!  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Ronnie 👍
Thanks Drew
Nah not the way to operate
Thanks Nick 👍🇺🇸
Aligned and on board
If automation is threat #1 climate change is #1A. They are linked because people can’t get their heads up to solve long-term problems if they can’t pay their bills. A mindset of abundance will enable us to think much bigger. Passing Universal Basic Income is the 1st big step.
Thanks Roy!  😀👍🇺🇸
.@TomSteyer is a great American leader. He is focused on the biggest problems we have including climate change and preserving our way of life. Surprised he’s not running for President - met him in Iowa - but he will continue to be a powerful force for progress and humanity.
Running as a Democrat
I can’t wait to beat this guy.
Thanks Carlos see you soon 👍
Good idea 👍
Love B Corps
Agree this is almost entirely on Donald Trump and Republicans
We persecute and villainize individuals and families who fall prey to financial problems due to ‘bad decisions.’  Then our government shuts down because our decisionmakers can’t get it together.  What a ridiculous double standard.
Next Feb 👍
Looks like my @Freakonomics interview drops on Wednesday night.  Excited for it!  😀
If the government were a business you would look to determine revenue sources. The best move is toward a VAT that would harness the gains from AI and new technologies. Our resources are ample if we channel them better. We are the richest society in the history of the world.
Dropping my son off at school reflecting on how much we rely on teachers then and now.
Again love markets.  But why optimize two-dimensionally along one currency?  We could do much more.
It should also be said that the market will systematically undervalue women and marginalized groups.  Women do most of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.  Better measurements would appropriately reward this work.
We can make the markets work for us, rather than follow an archaic GDP measurement off a cliff and continue to value ourselves at whatever the market values us at. We are more than the numbers on our bank statement.
Our best path forward is to redefine economic value around human well-being - health, mental health, freedom from substance abuse, sustainability, average quality of life, etc. - and create new markets and measurements that would actually tell us how we are doing.
The market will not care about displaced cashiers or truckers or accountants. It just wants to get things done as efficiently as possible. Capital efficiency will value machines over humanity more and more.
I admire and understand the power of markets to improve lives and create value. But people wil not be able to outcompete AI, self-driving vehicles, robots and software for a growing range of tasks. We need to evolve or else we will witness more and more of us being cast aside.
We have adapted to the marketplace as much as humanly possible.  It is time for the market to adapt to us.
Less than that.  More affordable than you think.
If this is a simulation it’s a very good one.
People talk about retraining as if we are all modular widgets.  Half of us weren’t trained for what we are doing right now.
Thanks Charlie.  Elizabeth would be glad to connect.
Thanks Zak
I find I do some of my best work when no one is paying me to do it.
Would love that Laura! 👍😀🇺🇸
For those of you hoping for me to have a convo with Joe Rogan you may get your wish soon.  😀
Thank you @RiversCuomo - you’re a true visionary.  Honored to have your support for my campaign.  Look forward to seeing you on tour!  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Hap 👍😀🇺🇸
I recently spoke at a gathering of financial CEOs.  I asked how many were looking at Artificial Intelligence replacing staff.  Virtually all of their hands went up.  They know what is coming.  They have a job to do just like everyone else.
I’m so glad to be running for President.  I sometimes imagine this race without us and it feels like we are contributing something very important.  Thank you.
Saw Eighth Grade and Three Identical Strangers over the holiday.  Would recommend them highly.  👍
Thanks for this
A year ago when I talked to truck drivers they said “there’s no way a robot could do my job.”  This year they say “we need to make robot trucks illegal.”  That’s an important change.
Yes.  Will be included 👍
Thanks Michael 👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Mike
Thanks Jill 👍🇺🇸😀
Sorry about that Jack!  It being NYE in NYC and all we opted for an open bar which brought certain limitations.  Please trust that we would LOVE to have you to any other event!!  Hope the New Year is off to a great start for you and yours.  Keep making great things happen.
Aligned and on board 👍🇺🇸
Hope you enjoy it!  👍😀
Louis CK deeply disappointing.  Could have engaged in a real and important conversation about second chances. Instead affirming his marginalization.
If this is Eli Manning’s last game as a Giant he deserves all the praise in the world.  Whether it’s sports, arts, culture or politics its nearly impossible to go out on top. To go out respected admired and healthy is the best most can hope for.
Yes the littler one
Jon Jones should head up to fight DC.  Only thing that makes sense.
Thanks Matt.  👍🇺🇸
Sure will do more of that 👍
Thanks!!  Let’s show what we can do 👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Doug 👍😀🇺🇸
47% figure includes this
Thank you 👍😀🇺🇸
Thank you Madison 👍😀🇺🇸
Yes
There are so many businesses and industries that traffic in complexity - health insurers, lawyers, accountants, financial planners, SEO consultants, etc.  AI and the blockchain are likely to simplify many of these processes over time; complexity will become the enemy.
Get rid of them 👍
One weakness of Dem policy is it places the onus on programs and universities and schools to fix what ails us. If you dig in you find that many of these institutions are not performing exceptionally well.  People know it. Instead of trusting institutions we need to trust people.
We should teach that.  😀
We should also try to make high school more relevant and useful.  Financial literacy, managing technology, positive psychology and relationship skills, all would help kids feel like school is actual preparation for adulthood instead of rote learning prescribed decades ago.
There are different paths to education and knowledge than our current structures.
Plus only 32% of Americans graduate from 4-year colleges. Why further subsidize the top third of the population?  Better to pass Universal Basic Income and let people pay for college or technical school or community college or start a business or pursue something independent.
Many progressives are for free college education. I’m for the spirit of that but think it is the wrong policy. You are pretending that college degrees create jobs. They don’t. They create underemployed college grads.
Families feel they have no choice but to send their kids to college at any price. And the government makes copious loans available essentially subsidizing the cost increases. Meanwhile the 6-year graduation rate is down to 59%. We are overprescribing college.
I get asked all the time about student loans. It’s immoral what we have done to our young people - loaded them up with $1.5 trillion in crippling debt. Meanwhile the underemployment rate for college grads is 44% and 94% of new jobs are temp jobs. Their paths forward aren’t there.
Thanks Robert McCollum from NC, Josh Sims from Kentucky and Greg Yu from Florida for donating today!  You all are the best 😀
You’d rather have finance making business more efficient rather than driving corporate strategy and investments to the extent it does today.
Thanks Jesse 👍😀🇺🇸
The fear here is that we don't have any new tricks. Steve Mnuchin's bizarre performance certainly didn't inspire any confidence. If things get really rough it's unclear what the next moves will be. We truly are entering uncharted territory. I fear it will not be pretty.
During the financial meltdown we printed $4 trillion for the banks and pushed interest rates to zero. That formed massive bubbles in the stock of private companies, coastal real estate and other asset classes that we have never really unwound. We have been pushing on a string.
The unfortunate truth though is that everyday Americans - the 47% who are not in the stock market at all - will suffer the most if the market goes down.  Their part-time jobs will dry up, the resources around them will wither, meaningful opportunities will disappear.
We have overindexed on the financialization of our economy.  @RanaForoohar goes into this in detail.  Disentangling the stock market's performance with how most Americans are doing is a necessary step.
I've always felt like politicians cheerleading the market is stupid - what is happening now had its origins years ago. It would be like trying to take credit for a positive weather pattern. This was true even before the market lost its relationship with the underlying economy.
It's been a while since I've had the feeling the market is going to go down and down and the only time it doesn't is when the market is closed.  That's what it feels like right now.  There may be hesitations and false starts.  But it feels like we are in for a very rough time.
This Warriors team doesn't seem to care too much.  Question is what happens come playoff time.  Will be prohibitive favorites until someone actually beats them when it counts.
Merry Christmas everybody!!  Hope you have a wonderful holiday with family and loved ones.  👍🌲😀
Aquaman is awesome.  Really fun time at the movies - my wife loved it too.  Congrats @creepypuppet on knocking it out of the park.
Hey Coll looks like it didn’t go through.  Can you reprocess?  Thank you and have a great holiday!!  🙏👍🇺🇸
Thanks Coll.  Will check for sure.  👍
This shutdown is super-stupid.  I can't see Democrats giving in and giving Trump his wall.  In the meantime the Republicans will just seem destructive and hell-bent on symbolic victories that don't actually solve anything.
Agree with this.  Would support statehood for DC.
Great potential
.@brett_mcgurk and I were friends and classmates. He worked for the last 3 administrations - a true rarity - to strengthen the Middle East.  His resignation is a bad thing for the country just like Mattis’s.
I fear that the next downturn will be more savage for workers than what has gone before, hard as that is to believe. It's repellent to me how capital-dependent our policy measures are. All we seem to be able to control is the cost of capital. There is real work to be done.
What scares the heck out of me is what corporations will do to their workforces during the next recession. Historically, managers wait to lay people off until a recession - then the knives come out. This time the knives will be turbocharged with new AI and software.
The connection between how our big corporations are doing and how our communities are doing has become virtually nonexistent. The companies don't really need us to succeed anymore.
GDP, the stock market and headline unemployment rate are our key measurements in the headlines. Yet they are all terrible measures of how we are doing. We need to evolve and develop better more nuanced measurements - like mental health, childhood success, average income, etc.
Thanks Reid 👍🇺🇸
Apparently members of Congress still get paid during a government shutdown.  Simple solution - change that.  We would never see another government shutdown again.
No reason to think it would lead to those things.  Support people having roofs over their heads and healthy food to eat.  👍
Most of this is on the Republicans as I’m sure the Dems would happily pass a permanent funding resolution tomorrow.
Imagine if a company shut down periodically because its leaders couldn’t decide on a budget. No one would deal with that company and everyone involved would be shown the door. That this is even possible shows just how dysfunctional our government has become. We accept too much.
Great sharing the stage with you Eric - let’s provide bold solutions indeed.  👍🇺🇸
A mindset of scarcity has overtaken our communities.  The only answer is abundance.  It’s hard to care about climate change when you can’t pay your bills.
Thank you!  👍😀🇺🇸
Got to be done though.
Yes.  Not easy.
@marknolte
Love ranked choice
There you are Mark!  Look forward to working with you to shape a future to be proud of.  Congrats on all you do brother👍🇺🇸🥊
Coming to @sxsw
Thanks!  😀👍
On the way back to Iowa.  Amazing people and always have a blast.  👍😀🇺🇸  This is my 7th trip.
Think we spend too much on the wrong things.  Would move resources to infrastructure.
Will go up very quickly as people learn more.  Goal #1 is to be an option.  👍
Thanks Brian.  Much appreciated.
What I loved is that some people tabbed me as one of their top choices.  If we grow that we can move the whole election.
Got to start somewhere 👍
Odd I agree
NYC
Thanks Geoff 👍😀🇺🇸
Ha thanks Bill 👍
Thank you Ralph.  Excited to connect.  Agree re: environment.  👍
Anthony Davis is heading to the Lakers next year.  Too many signs.
I am for it 👍
Optimists thought that the Internet would unite humanity.  But it amplifies the negative very powerfully and makes people capable of things they would never say in person.  Exhibit #3,659,213: the cruelty toward Pete Davidson.
Doesn’t really.  But in at least some cases gives people resources to get out of the house and possibly gives entire community more energy and opportunities.  More non-profits and different types of activities too.  Several million more jobs throughout economy.
Average many much higher
Amazing
I’ve run several companies.  Sold a private company to a public company for millions of dollars.  I understand the bottom line very clearly.
Studied economics. US already making transfers of trillions of dollars to people in various forms. You are trafficking in absolutes that don’t apply.
Socialism is the nationalization of the means of production.  Putting money into people’s hands strengthens consumer markets and businesses.  Will create jobs and entrepreneurs.  Failure to act will destroy what is left of the middle class.
You are thinking too small.  The math checks out easily.  A mindset of scarcity is the path to ruin.  We have nearly unimaginable resources.
Yes future of sports I think.  Will only become more mainstream and push people inside.
Thanks Jeff
Alleviate misery reorganize economy activate true democracy
Yes totally different
Any GM who passed on Luka Doncic should be fired.
We’ve lost 5 million manufacturing jobs.  A rebound of a few hundred thousand is significant but doesn’t turn the macro trend.
It’s much more benign than people think.  Think Amex points and social impact bonds.  😀
For VAT that would capture gains.  Covers all companies but most dramatic value gains would be from tech.
Thanks Max
Median wages have been stagnant for decades. Meanwhile housing costs, education and healthcare costs have skyrocketed. This economy is increasingly punitive. Putting rosy stats on it just shows how perverse the stats are. We need new measurements for a human-centered economy.
The Unemployment Rate might be the worst. Labor force participation rate down to 62.9% same as El Salvador and Dominican Republic. 1 in 5 prime working age men hasn’t worked in a year. 94 million out of the workforce. 44% of recent grads underemployed. 94% of new jobs are temp.
Even the inventor of GDP, Simon Kuznets, said that his invention is a terrible measure of national well-being and we shouldn’t use it as such.  Also said parenthood should be included.
Bobby Kennedy: “[GNP] does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play . . . it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”
.@PhilipKHoward said to me that the economy demonstrates our values.  Who wakes up excited about GDP?  We have better values than this.
We now apply advanced analytics to things like hitting a ball with a stick and fielder placement. Yet for our economy we rely on outdated measurements that lead us astray. GDP the Unemployment Rate and stock prices mask what is truly going on. We are capable of doing much better.
Thank you!
Hey Nick would enjoy that.  Let’s do it.  👍😀🇺🇸
VAT plus existing spending plus growth plus cost savings plus value gains gets you to that figure
Thanks Zach.  Let’s get there.  👍🇺🇸
The behavior of lame-duck Republicans in Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin is a new low.  It’s like elections don’t matter unless you win.
Thanks John.  Let’s show what we can do 👍🇺🇸
Having the chance to fight for a future you believe in is a rare privilege.  Feels great.  👍😀🇺🇸
Yes.  Antitrust laws need to be revamped to focus on factors beyond price gouging 👍
Will do
Thank you Ezra Quinn from Arkansas, Meg Li from CA and Kenya Gomez from NYC for donating today!  We see and appreciate every dollar.  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Romeen 👍🇺🇸🙏
Thanks @opinion_joe for the thoughtful work
Thanks Pete 👍😀🇺🇸
Enjoyed the convo with @erinwinick 👍😀🇺🇸
Will check thanks
Just invited to speak at @sxsw next Spring - something to look forward to 👍🎉🇺🇸
Thanks Simone enjoyed the talk as well.
Need to strengthen social security- different plan.  I have parents too.   👍
VAT that includes data
Thanks Chris!  😀👍
Glad you are enjoying it Alan!  👍🥊
What is your Venmo?
Thanks Shawn - yes I do.  👍🥊🇺🇸
Thanks for having me Dan - enjoyed the convo 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Jess!
Benjamin Hunnicut, a historian at the University of Iowa, argues that if a cashier’s job were a video game, we would call it completely mindless and the worst game ever designed. But if it’s called a job, politicians praise it as dignified and meaningful.
I love this Mets trade.  Trying to win is the first and most important step.  👍🥊👏
Thanks!  👍😀🇺🇸
Will miss Wilmer Flores in Queens.
Would love that
Now the speaker talking bravely about training programs for drivers.  Haven’t seen one of those.  Well-intended fantasy.  Talking about them irresponsible.
@KyleKulinski Hey Kyle thanks for the thoughtful coverage.  Would love to talk more - feel free to drop me a line as I'm here in New York.
As a Dem actually.  But Independent in thought.  👍🇺🇸
Excited for this- and Congratulations Cindy and Abby!!  👍🇺🇸
I would have bet money that Fultz was going to Cleveland for Kyle Korver.  Made sense for both teams.
Excited for this!  👍🇺🇸
Include environmental quality as an economic measurement and drive toward improving it
Happy to 👍😀
Opt in can keep current benefits if preferable
People still price sensitive.  And still competition between firms.
Sure
Should be able to vote
Thanks Kyle.  Would love to talk to you more - I think we are aligned on the big things.  Keep up the great work.  👍🥊
Thanks 👍
If I were a billionaire you'd be seeing my stuff EVERYWHERE.  ;)
Don’t know where you got the idea I’m a billionaire . . .
Very much not the plan.
Yes I do.  Unsurprising unfortunately.
👍
Thanks Rory
Bitcoin losing value is a continued “risk-off” signal for speculative assets.
Hope to be back soon 👍🇺🇸
@mishachellam this one is for you
Thanks Scott 👍😀🇺🇸
Would still be lower
Thanks Isidro.  👍🇺🇸🙏
Thank you Rose - Happy Thanksgiving!!  👍😀🇺🇸
Needs to get overhauled and strengthened
Sure we can start and move it up
Working on it 😀
Thanks Ellyn
System will absorb more from wealthy than that.
No more idiotic than a system that charges hundreds of thousands for a degree that probably doesn’t make sense.
You can do that too
Reallocate some military spending to infrastructure which would add more economic value over time.  Use tech to streamline government.
1.slight change 2. Deficit neutral 3. Customers have more money 4. No
Didn’t interview with him.
Just did the @Freakonomics podcast today and am excited for it come out in the coming days!  Stephen Dubner is world-class.  👍
Thank you.  Restore me!  😀👍🇺🇸
Today is the Day of Remembrance for transgender victims of violence.  Hopefully we can evolve to a point where our shared humanity is more powerful than our differences. Thanks Nick for letting me know.
Hope you enjoy it Alan
Money goes to services will create incentives to serve people
Doing my best Joshua
Pretty sure unfortunately 🤨
Having people from more varied socioeconomic backgrounds attending an elite school like JHU is obviously a positive thing as is those people graduating with less debt. But the likely scenario here is that the wealthiest schools like JHU will invest resources in access.
Nah I’m campaigning for a world where humans are central to the economy not tangential.  👍
Agree we must change the rules of the master market intelligence.  Change the measurements and you change everything.
Thanks DJ!  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thank you!!  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Megan 👍😀🇺🇸
New accountability measurements for government tied to comp 👍
Thank you Nick - let’s make history together 😀🇺🇸🥊
Thanks Rodney 👍😀🇺🇸
Flying to Iowa with the ultimate choice - Five Guys or Panda Express for lunch.
It seems the Day of Reflection in New York is NOT happening this weekend.  It’s too bad as I was looking forward to meeting people.  We will make another occasion. 👍
Thanks Jehiely 👍😀🇺🇸
Working on it.  Was on TYT this week.  👍
Thanks Clark.
Thank you Kim!  👍🇺🇸🥊
Thank you!  👍🥊🇺🇸
Will try to get there
I’ll be major soon 😀
Let’s change that 👍
Just keep spreading the word 👍🇺🇸🥊
What a life Stan Lee.  Touched so many lives.  👍🎉👏
Thank you - hope you enjoy it.  👍😀
Thanks Jennifer!  👍😀🇺🇸
Happy Veterans Day and thank you to all of our service members for all you’ve done for your country.  👍🇺🇸⭐️  We appreciate it every day.
Lower than the cost of rampant wildfires, property damage and loss of life over time.
One can imagine a tech-oriented set of countermeasures to the wildfires in CA. Heat sensors deployed in each acre of brush, drones equipped with fire retardants, rapid response team etc.  Seems that the problem is when the fires grow out of control - early on more manageable.
About half of Americans currently receive cash transfers from the US government.
Did Ezra too!  Working on Joe.  😀
Sam already had me on 🙏
Through people like you Michael
Thanks Kevin!  👍🇺🇸
Occasionally people ask me how I can pass Universal Basic Income.  Just requires a Congressional majority.  Nothing more.  It passed the House in 1971.  This time it will go all the way.
Someone will trade something decent for Fultz.  For a bad team he’s a high-upside bet.
Thanks Peter.  Tech may not be ready for prime time.  Hopefully we will get there.  👍
This Jimmy Butler trade is a win for the Sixers and not a great return for the Wolves.  Fultz is getting traded by year-end.  The pressure is on.
Just the start
The unprecedented wildfires in California this late in the year are devastating. Climate change is impacting communities in more and more terrifying ways. We should invest hundreds of billions in making our infrastructure more resilient and mitigating the worst effects.
No inflation doesn’t work like that happily 👍
January Ben!
Thanks Quentin.  See you tomorrow.  🥊😀🇺🇸
Yes need to fix SS in the worst way.
Thanks Carlos!  👍🥊🇺🇸
Thanks Pam - will do 👍
Thanks Mike.  I like most Dems!
@Scholten4Iowa @RobSandIA!!  Do it!!
Excited for @Axne4Congress @Abby4Iowa and hopefully @FredHubbell in Iowa. Agree with the need to strengthen democracy.  👍
Tonight has to be considered a disappointment for the Democrats. So many quality candidates lost close races.
If @BetoORourke beats Ted Cruz it would almost make up for any other disappointments on the night.  🙏
Not even @taylorswift13 could push Tennessee 😟.
Ah Florida.  I love Andrew Gillum.  Hope he pulls this out!
Running for office is a big deal.  Let’s get out and vote tomorrow.  🇺🇸👏👍
Thanks Ed!  👍
As a parent one thing I’ve noticed is that every third cartoon is warning kids about stranger danger. No wonder we have become so mistrustful.
Thanks!!
Just because something hasn’t been true in the past does not mean that it will never come to pass.  The numbers tell a clear story in the here and now.
Yes just retweeted!  👍👏🙏
Thanks Pat.  Would love for you to dig in.  👍
Yes it’s in the thread below 👍
The Jubilee.  👍😀🇺🇸
Turns out it’s in Soho!  They moved it to suit demand.  👍
Haha will check.
Would enjoy that a great deal 👍🇺🇸
There is a lot of innovation possible if manufacturers are aligned.  Right now the incentives are inverted.  But appreciate thoughtful disagreement.
That’s the problem.  Let’s take over the government and change it.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Ben
If you’re walking around worried about how to survive month-to-month you are more likely to lash out and respond to hateful messages and ideas.
We have to turn around the hate.  America is heading the wrong direction and we have to do much more and think much bigger about possible solutions. Improving rhetoric will help but will not address the root causes.
I know it’s true for everyone but I feel terrible and terrified for my Jewish friends. So many have lost family members to violence and anti-Semitism. It hits home for them like for very few others because of their history of persecution. Imagine having your worst fears realized.
Thanks John.  Agree to disagree - but welcome thoughtful disagreement.  👍
Unlike most you’re doing something about it Antony.  Let’s fix it for our kids.  👍👏🥊
Not all - just those that would dramatically increase your danger to others
Thanks Shafqat.  See you soon.
This shooting in Pittsburgh is a new level of darkness and hate. My heart goes out to the families and communities affected. There’s nothing left to say except we have to make it much harder to get guns in this country, particularly those that can incur mass casualties.
Thanks Lesa!  😀
Thank you!  👍
Universal Basic Income would help broaden access to resources and give millions of Americans a chance to pursue the business or organization or creative endeavor they’ve always wanted to start.  It would enhance our culture and economy.
Unfortunately people with lower access to capital and resources often never get off the starting block. And a disproportionate number of those with lower access are members of marginalized groups.
Welfare disincentivizes success in a way that Universal Baaic Income does not.
Thanks Parker.  A VAT to me is necessary over time to harness the gains from tech and automation.  People would retain vast majority of UBI and bottom 92% would have increased buying power 👍
@BootsRiley is a freaking genius 👍👏
Finally watching @sorry2botheryou damn this movie is smart well-acted and profound.  Wish it wasn't so close to real life.  @steveyeun represent.
Thank you Gabrielle!!  👍😀🇺🇸
Thanks Atul - congrats on all you do.
Hey David we are very aligned.  👍
He did indeed do that too
Depends on how one defines production
Yes
So glad these mailbombs have been caught and defused so far. Need to catch the perpetrator - but that won’t reverse current trends toward political violence. True security is more likely in a fair, prosperous and unified society. We have a long way to go.
@GregJKrieg Hey Greg congrats on the great work.  Would love to touch base - I have a story that might be a fit for you.  Let me know if you have time upcoming.  I'm based in New York.  Hope to connect soon.  - Andrew
@justincharity Hello Justin - enjoy your work on The Ringer a great deal.  Would love to get together here in New York to talk about my campaign.  My HQ is at West 39th St.  Let me know.  Let's solve the big problems.  Yours, - Andrew
@scholten4iowa you too brother.  Beat that guy.
Thanks for including me Tim - you're going to win my friend!  Character wins.
Yes great choices.  Have people in common with Abrams, Beto and Gillum but haven't met them yet.
Thanks @RobSandIA @TimForIowa @Abby4Iowa @DelgadoforNY19 @AndyKimNJ @Axne4Congress @GrayforNH for stepping up - you all are patriots and make me proud to be a Democrat.
I think the GMs of the Jets and Giants should get together and decide that one team should stockpile players and the other one gets picks.  Then New York would have one really good team and the other would have a future.  The GiantJets ("Gents") would be awesome.
@realDonaldTrump either knows it's nonsense or keeps selling it
Many people assume 2 things about the economy 1) In order to grow companies must hire more people 2) treating people well is integral to success. Unfortunately neither of these is true today. Companies can now become very successful without hiring people or treating them well.
And it looks like it’s 4 games for Ingram 3 for Rondo and 2 games for Paul.  MUCH more lenient than I thought.
Thanks Adam.
Mildly
Thanks Richard.  👍🇺🇸🙏
Thank you Sandra - look forward to continuing the convo.  Hope you enjoy the book!  Copy on its way to you.  😀👍🇺🇸

Knicks home opener vs Hawks and @JLin7 not a sellout.  Guess New Yorkers’ appetite for terrible basketball is not limitless.

Yes let’s do it 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Penny we will investigate .  Keep at it!  👍🇺🇸
We can change it Luis 👍🇺🇸
Gains from AI and automation
Thank you Penny!  Let's fight for humanity.
Thanks Zach - look forward to moving society forward alongside you in the years to come!  :)
Adjusted annually to inflation yes
The Giants should totally sign @Kaepernick7 - they don’t have a viable backup to Eli and could use a mobile quarterback.  What a great story that would be.  👍🇺🇸
Losing sleep is more like it
@AbdulElSayed coming to Detroit November 8 - would love to get together.  Let’s do some work.
Thanks Jacob.  👍🇺🇸  Appreciate your thoughtful review.  😀
Grants to local orgs and papers would simply support local journalism and points of view.
Maybe Saquon Barkley can play quarterback
Prefer VAT but know what you mean
Thanks John 👍🇺🇸
Should be regulated but not criminalized
A market correction is overdue and could be significant
Thanks Carolyn 👍
Ha thanks Jessica 😀
@Weezer @RiversCuomo your fans would love this
They’d probably do it if I asked nicely
Thanks Cooper.  See you before long.
Thanks Eric! 😀🇺🇸
Yes!  Let’s book it.  😀
Coming to Denver for sure @sairasameerarao 👍
@epicprops
This was a lot of fun.  👍😀
Thank you Karen for doing the work
You know times are tough when reason seems revolutionary.
Thank you 👍
I like it.  We all benefit.
The bottom line is we need to believe  in ourselves and our people. The best way to strengthen children and families is from each home up. We are not costs - we are the owners of this society and the whole point of the economy is to improve our lives.
We spend billions on consultants and programs for schools and expect teachers to do the impossible. We spend a lot of money per student.  We just don’t spend it on the two things that would make the biggest difference: 1. Higher teacher pay 2. Improving student conditions at home
Thanks Jeffrey.  Let’s do something about it.  👍
Working on that Edward - mechanism is Scoial Security which needs to be strengthened 👍
Glad to be there with you Jerry!!  😀🙏🇺🇸
Open to it - dramatic step but may be warranted
A few innovations could have an outsized impact.  Autonomous vehicles may not show up in the numbers until they do.
Yes
Thank you - appreciate the thoughtful review a great deal 👍🇺🇸
UBI appealing to both sides
Thanks Seth
I think Khabib is going to win it tonight in Round 3.  Would be fun if Conor proves me wrong.
Thank you Ash!
The Freedom Dividend is my name for it
Part III is a bit more uplifting 👍
Thanks.  I didn’t think that sketch was implausible myself.
Thanks Zach.  👍
Thanks Alex!
I like progress 👍
Fed job guarantee leads to armies of dystopian employees doing makework as government dependents to survive.  Intention is good but it’s a terrible idea.  There are better ways to provide structures and resources than top-down.
Thanks Jamie 👍
Thanks Donny
He’s already in the basement.  This will get him part of the way out.
Thanks Des 👍🇺🇸
Thanks Chris 👍
Unfortunately no.  Congress has to make it happen.
Next time Noah 👍
One of my first actions as President will be to overturn Citizens United which was an absolutely terrible decision.  It may require a Constitutional amendment.  Our politics have been overrun by corporate money.  Getting it out and restoring a sense of true democracy is Job 1.
No 😟
Thank you John.  You are a leader and person of the highest order.  Let’s grow the tribe.  👍🇺🇸
If you were to combine the Giants and Jets you might have one good football team.
Social Security needs to be reformed strengthened and enhanced.  Different plan.  But for the spirit of it.
This one-week delay and investigation will change the course of history.
I’ll take them if it means we solved the problem. 👍
Thanks Matt - looking forward to it!  👍
Next town over.  Mobile home.  Co-op.  Collective.  Construction.  Egregious rent will drive responses.
Thanks Cody!
College tuition is skyrocketing not because consumers have choices - quite the opposite.  It is skyrocketing because government has subsidized massive loans just for education.  I’d scale that back.
You are overlooking second order effects.  More money in people’s hands means more consumer flexibility more competition more consumer-facing opportunities.  Will  invigorate and empower local businesses and improve democratic processes.
This guy is the opposite of what you’d want in a Supreme Court Justice.
It seems to me that she is courting death threats and disruption of her life by coming forward.  Her incentives are very much not to.
Christine Blasey Ford is a very brave woman.
Thanks to all who wrote in! A winner was selected this morning at 11:11 am EST and was messaged for their prize. Lots of fun.
I love it.  True democracy.  👍🇺🇸

Holy cow have we gotten a ton of donations today - from Lindsey in Minnesota, Uday in Tampa, Andrew in Newark and many many more.  Thank you.  🙏🇺🇸  With your help we can change the course of history.
Thank you!!  Great to have you - I have a little guy too!  😀❤️
I’ll do it.
Saw Steven.  I think we are more aligned than that.  Different variables and time frames.
@AndyStern_DC way to elevate the next wave 👍
Thanks Damon 👍
Agree Austin 🇺🇸👍
@novogratz @arielhelwani @benfowlkesMMA @BrendanSchaub @joerogan this story will only grow
Indirectly 👍
Unfortunately with climate change the need for infrastructure improvement and disaster mitigation will only rise.  The more we spend now the less we spend later.
One problem with the US is our inability to rebuild the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, Flint and elsewhere- the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers is only $4.8 billion for the entire country. I’d dramatically increase that and build capacity. USACE should be able to do more.
Thanks Jamie
Thanks Jeroen
Hopefully we can make reason the central pillar of our policy and decision making.  That’s my mission.
Thank you Aaron!
Thanks Keith!  Means a lot.  👍🇺🇸
Thanks Sardeth 👍
No - inflation isn’t being driven by purchasing power.  Education, healthcare, housing all dysfunctional regulated markets.  Other things not experiencing inflation l.  Still price competition between firms and price sensitivity among consumers.
In economy of $19 trillion integrity of dollar will not be in question.  Still global reserve currency.  Printed $4 trillion for banks no issue.  This is much better actual stimulus.
Thanks Jim
Companies pay into transition fund for healthcare costs
Yes to Freedom Dividend.  In UBI section - a VAT plus current spending plus cost savings plus new revenue from economic growth.  Medicare for all can be funded from savings to businesses- we spend 2x what other countries do to worse results
Yes hopefully this will take form over the next 2 years as we make the case and gather steam
Plan A first.  But yes there are things we could do on the outside.
If Puerto Ricans looked like Swedes I bet the Trump government would have had a more robust response to Maria.
18 year olds in the military get all sorts of training.  But I know what you mean.
Or richer stronger and more thoughtful and resilient
Thanks Mary.  Let’s change what work means.  👍
I cite scarcity and child development studies in the book.  Includes evidence of racism with scarcity mindset and bandwidth constraints.
This too.
None of this happens without a political revolution. We need to grind and fight our way there. We need to do better than shrug off shootings as unavoidable - that’s insane. We are a society that can change and improve things. Let’s do it for our children - they deserve better.
Eighth we should start a help line that people can call if they suspect someone of being a potentially violent shooter-in-the-making.  Much of the time people nearby can sense a time bomb. Hopefully a lot of the time we can get someone appropriate treatment in a non-public way.
As part of mental health we need to evaluate our prescription drug and anti-depressant policies. We are overprescribing many of these drugs in a way that is causing bad reactions and overdependence in ways that sometimes leads to violent episodes. Drugs aren’t a cure all.
Seventh we need to invest in our underdeveloped mental health infrastructure.  A lot of people are suffering from mental illness and not getting treatment.  There is a massive need to destigmatize these issues and increase resources.  We need to help parents in particular.
Sixth we should start an ammunition registry where if someone buys an unusually large amount of ammunition it raises a level of scrutiny.  In at least some cases mass shooters bought a lot of ammunition in a short period of time.
Fifth we should offer to buy back guns and offer free upgrades to a signature gun so that only the owner can fire it.  Would make guns safer and some owners would love it because it makes their guns only theirs.  Need to try to reduce numbers over time.
Fourth we should institute a system of fines anytime a firearm gets used in a mass shooting on the gun manufacturer.  Right now mass shootings INCREASEgun sales and manufacturers don’t have an incentive to prevent them. Fining manufacturers would change behavior and incentives.
Third we should curb the ownership of assault weapons and weapons that can incur mass casualties quickly.  There is no practical reason for a citizen to have military-grade weaponry.  If you really want to fire an assault weapon you can go to a shooting range.
Second we should raise the legal age of gun ownership to 21.  Teenage brains are more likely to short-circuit, particularly in a school setting.  21 is drinking age - should be gun ownership age too.
We should treat owning a gun the same way we do driving a car. You take a test. You get a license. You lose your license if you do something suspect, like beating your wife, or you get flagged for criminality or mental illness. You lose your driver’s license for DUI.  Same thing.
I find the thoughts and prayers expression maddening.  We don’t elect legislators for their sympathy.  We elect them to pass intelligent laws that improve society.  If a legislator didn’t care but made my kids less likely to be shot I would be excited for that lawmaker.
I’m more into meaningful regulation than thoughts and prayers myself.  👍🇺🇸
Jimmy Butler will land with the Clippers I think.  They make the most sense.
Beyond the capacity of many unfortunately.
Thank you John.  See you soon looking forward to it! 👍🇺🇸
Yes need to start adapting.  Those scenarios are either here with us or coming fast one way or another.
Agree
I’m technically now a politician
Some of them
Hoping to
Great meeting you too Jackson.  👍  Let’s make the big changes.
Time will catch up to me if we wake enough people up.  👍
Strong societies treat women well.  Unfortunately we are not as strong as we should be.  And we are getting weaker.
The need is growing for a public role in media similar to the BBC in the UK.  The fact is most of America is heading toward depletion of local journalism and consolidation of national firms.  Does anyone really think Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post is a good idea?
Marc Benioff buying Time Magazine is a sign of the times. Publishing still has a very powerful place in society in shaping views and culture. But its financial viability is diminishing. Techies are in the opposite position - lots of money and seeking cultural sway and influence.
Thank you Zach!  Will try to get there.  👍
If I could I would Jack.  😀
Some things some will find handy and useful. Others will ignore. That’s America. Better choices for more people with Freedom Dividend, single-payer healthcare, affordable education, student loan forgiveness lightening the load. Get things off our backs so we can do what we want.
4 people.  Could be 2 families.  Or 1.  And the work in the fields is up to you.  And you don’t have to use any tools you don’t want to.  Nothing is required - not even the $1k a month everyone gets.
Thank you Kyle 🙏
We need to become extremely socialist in some respects and extremely capitalist in others - in ways that improve humanity. Our present system is inhuman and needs a soul.
Thank you - for what it’s worth I watch Black Mirror.  Trying to keep most of it from happening in real life.  These are dark times.
Thanks Zane.  👍
Yes
Thanks Jonathan.  Peter we met briefly at @EricRWeinstein’s.  I hope to move our country forward.
Thanks Ash. I think that all people are humans and that our system has become demented in its fetishization of certain types of intelligence. People are people and we need to stop treatimg people as cogs and economic inputs. I’m not insane enough to evaluate human worth that way.
Appreciate your zeal and principles.  You may find that we share more than you believe.
Labels are powerful but they may or may not always be what we should be focusing on.  The current path leads to ruin and disintegration.  Let’s change it as fast as we possibly can.
I’m for a Freedom Dividend of $1k a month, single-payer healthcare, school loan forgiveness, new measurements for the economy that include nurturing and caregiving and other changes that would help people in real life.  I need your help to make them real.
Yes
We have to broaden our notion of merit - if we were to go strictly on test scores Asians might be 42-73% of elite students as they are at Berkeley and Stuyvesant. That doesn’t serve the school, society, or even Asians optimally. Test scores and grades aren’t character or worth.
I have a sense of what these schools would look like in the absence of these policies. Even based on socioeconomic diversity they would look dramatically different than what they look like today and completely unrepresentative of the population at large.
“Poor impulse control.”
Yes.  Hiro Protagonist.   I still cite Neal Stephenson all of the time.  👍
But if a few companies have your ordering history, viewing preferences, travel data, personal relationships, etc. how can a new company come up to compete?  It probably can’t. Or if it does it will quickly get bought and bolted on to an existing Goliath.
In a world where scale and data are going to be the keys to success it’s going to be nearly impossible to compete. You kind of want the one megacompany to make the most efficient use of your data to make your life easier and more convenient, or have all your friends on it.
Our government regs still assume a world where the danger of market power is gouging consumers.  The danger is now the reverse - that you can build a platform and undercut all competitors to lock up an industry or category and consolidate control.
AI is only going to accelerate these dynamics.  The concentration is going to be unthinkable as they snap up any company that produces a promising algorithm or proprietary dataset.  Competition doesn’t work like it used to in a field like that.
@timoreilly calls it “Supermoney” when some of these companies don’t even need to show reasonable profits in order to justify massive valuations.  Amazon is the biggest example of this.  A Wal-mart exec asked “how do you compete against a company that doesn’t need to make money?”
With a giant market cap you can do things like 1) offer a few billion dollars for any company that starts to show promise or pose a threat or could add value 2) hire an army of the most talented people you can find and pay them unbelievable amounts in stock compensation
You don’t think 5 people with UBI could get together to buy a house to fix up?  Thinking only of the potential limitations of putting money directly into people’s hands is underestimating the possibilities.
For the record I think that the lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asians is misplaced. Schools should be able to consider different factors to achieve various goals.  Asians are 23% of the entering class - a new high-water mark.
Those jobs drive tax revenue which helps fund schools and all of the great things in the community.  So would Universal Basic Income which is the heart of my campaign.  Need to get more buying power and opportunity into people’s hands.
Thanks for this.  Build things means starting businesses that employ people and create value around the country (as opposed to head to the coasts and become a banker).  Of course teaching kids is great too.  😀👍
Reached out have yet to hear back
To be clear I'd be for enabling voting rights if it trended the other direction too.  On this one it's clear that the formerly incarcerated paid their debt to society and shouldn't have their rights curtailed.
The principle is right.  So is the impact.  Tied together.  Which is meaningful - that if you empower more people to vote it happens to trend in a particular direction.
This may be the most important thing going on in the country right now.  Florida is a swing state and this would shift it blue.  I donated and you should too.  👍 @YesTo2ndChances @desmondmeade
Ha yes it’s evolved a little since then 😀
Foreign workers won’t be driving trucks from afar
UBI better approach more $$ for people
No just a big step in the right direction.
Need to make that better.  Will strengthen Social Security benefits I have parents too.  👍🇺🇸
Heart and spirit
Should read ‘underemployed’
Thanks Julie! 👍😀
Excellent let’s do it Vic 👍🇺🇸
Yes overstatement on my part.  It needs to be intelligently regulated and moderated.  👍
Pilot direct democracy
Hope you enjoy the read!  😀
Met Votem through Venture for America
Being fired for trying to organize is coercion.
Then let them organize.  Same is true in MLB, NBA etc.
Agree weed needs to be moderated and intelligently regulated.  Overstatement on my part.
Thanks Lex!  Means a lot.  Let’s get likeminded people on board.  👍🇺🇸
The memes are hard to resist its true
Agree - harmless is the wrong term.  Needs intelligent regulation and moderation.  👍
A lot of work is repetitive.  That’s one of the problems.
Yes would ramp up forgiveness programs.  Grad schools have indeed been among the worst.
Thanks Markus!  👍
Thanks Henry 👍
You helped make it happen brother.  😀👍
@scottsantens you too 🙏😀
Thank you Doug.  You are a visionary and a builder.
Need to stick up for @LeslieSmith_GF @ALIAQUINTA @IamRagin for doing what’s right.  @marc_raimondi @arielhelwani @novogratz @joerogan
If you go bankrupt you can discharge auto loans. No one sells you half a car - but If you don’t graduate they still charge you. You could resell your car. Cars haven’t tripled in price.  You’re not told to buy a car or be deemed a failure as a kid. Car dealers aren’t tax-exempt.
But on top of UBI pretty good 😀
Quite happy 😀
Adds to the charm
Yes let’s get rid of much of that interest.  Gov’t shouldn’t make a dime.
I do think community colleges and public universities should be free. But I think presenting free college as the panacea to our opportunity woes won’t work. Only 32% of Americans graduate from four-yr colleges. Better to give UBI and let people use it in different ways.
I would be open to other ways to forgive or diminish the burden of student loans as it would give people their futures back and be a stimulus to the economy. People would be more likely to buy homes, start families, start businesses and everything else we need. I’m pro-jubilee.
My plan would be to tie federal college funding to lower ratios of administrators to students, bring down the cost of student loans, and destigmatize and dramatically invest in vocational education.
The real opportunity is in vocational and technical training. Only 6% of US high school students are in technical tracks. In Germany it is 59%. There are 15 million unfilled middle-skill jobs in the US that will be with us for a long time. Those jobs are often tough to automate.
Call it the Student Loan Emancipation Act. What we have done to our children is immoral. We have sold them on a college education as the end-all be-all.  Meanwhile underemployment rates among recent grads are up to 44% and 41% don’t graduate in 6 years.  We have oversold college.
Thanks Tom.  Me too.  👍
Thanks Jeff 👍
Thanks! 👍
Thank you Sam!  👍😀
I would leave them alone and make the Freedom Dividend opt-in
This is already happening
Would be helpful in many industries.  In some they would balk because of increased costs and low return on labor (retail, food service)
Pursue improving lives and then make it stick 👍
This doesn’t happen without major incentive changes.  Which I would be for.
Banks would love to sign up these millions of new customers
I should add that I worked as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant with workers bused in from Chinatown.  The community has always been diverse. Now moreso from different nations of origin.
Business ownership among young people has collapsed.  Not many people making those early attempts
I think things have changed since those people came up
@Nike keep it up 👍🇺🇸
I love Nike using @Kaepernick7 as the face of its ads.  It will only help in the long run.  Leadership often requires sacrifice.  Colin Kaepernick is clearly an @NFL quarterback.  That he doesn’t have a job is ridiculous.
@johnklin 👍
Thank you!!  👍
@FranklinFoer
Let’s get it going.  After it’s in place can always revisit.
Thanks Andrew.  Let’s change the course of history.
I appreciate every single bit of support I get.  Every dollar, every conversation, every kind word, every high-tech social affirmation.  Early adopters are the best.  👍  Let’s show what we can do.
“I don’t like patience because patience is not yummy.” - My 3 year old son.
For student loan forgiveness
@iamwesmoore
America.  Dems were in charge for part of it.
Why indeed
We as in America.  Dems were in charge for some of it.
Yes
We as in America.
Addressing the aftermath of the automation of manufacturing jobs - and soon, millions of retail and trucking jobs - requires a much more robust set of solutions than most Dems are willing to offer.  That’s what needs to change. The system must evolve.
Dems can’t talk about this because they have recast themselves as the party of the prosperous urban coastal elite and cloaked themselves in cultural issues. It’s not words people care about - it’s numbers. Most people just want a path forward for themselves and their families.
We are about to triple down on automation in retail, transportation, customer service and food prep - the most common jobs in the economy.  This trend will accelerate and get much worse.  Demographics won’t save Dems.  The rot will spread.  Despair turns blue to red.
Tech is the new land
Votes.  Let’s get them.
Thanks Christopher
Universal Basic Income will also help us broaden and redefine work and value. It is pro-work in the most fundamental of ways. People will do more of the most important work every day in a more human-centered economy. We will work harder on better things and solve bigger problems.
Thanks Brett.
Priorities that people care deeply about - health, education, children, resilience, women, innovation, dynamism, freedom, equity, community - all are enhanced and strengthened by Universal Basic Income.  People argue for it all the time without realizing it.  They will.
In a democracy there is absolutely nothing stopping us from voting ourselves a dividend.  There is no magic - it simply requires an act of Congress.  Alaska has had a dividend for 36 years.  Our shared resources are unimaginably vast.
Opening people up toward the possibility of abundance is not easy.  But when the possibility becomes real it will be overpowering.  It is our role to help others realize what is possible.
We are programmed for scarcity which serves us well in many instances.  But now that will lead us in the wrong direction.  We have to shift towards abundance.
A neuroscientist in Seattle said to me “The enemy of Universal Basic Income is the human mind.”  He was right.  Minds and hearts are opening every day.
Everyone wants Universal Basic Income without realizing they want Universal Basic Income.  This is a giant that is stirring.  When it wakes there will be no going backwards.
There’s not much left beyond shame.  To preserve its power we shouldn’t overuse it.
I wonder how @serenawilliams @jimmykimmel @BenAffleck @adamlevine @theweeknd and other @wme clients who invested in the @ufc will respond when they realize that their agents have gotten them into bed with @realdonaldtrump and @danawhite to exploit fighters like @LeslieSmith_GF.
in the war of words between @JeffBezos and @SenSanders over Amazon worker conditions, pay and treatment I have the feeling that Bernie and the press are going to find some pretty objectionable stuff.  This was not a fight that Jeff and @amazon should want.
Not pictured 😟
Thanks Joel 👍
Hell yeah Mike!  Let’s do it.  DM me I’ve got an interview tomorrow and would love to include you.  👍
Marginal NBA players get paid millions.
You would think.  Some people get mad when others get treated fairly I guess.
You’ve given Bellator approximately zero dollars.
Leslie tried to get a better deal for others and got fired.  You think that’s a fair negotiation?
No inflation doesn’t follow purchasing power because there’s still cost sensitivity among consumers and competition between firms. Current inflation in health care, education and housing driven by other factors.
Apparently @realDonaldTrump bailed out @danawhite and the @ufc by burying @LeslieSmith_GF's complaint to the National Labor Relations Board AFTER her claim HAD ALREADY BEEN APPROVED by the NLRB Region 4 and held that fighters are employees.  This shit is hard to believe.
@benfowlkesMMA has it right.  Thanks for being a voice of reason.
Of course Leslie - keep fighting the good fight.  👍
Eventually we put an end to sweatshops.  This one will be no different.
@joerogan might be one of the only people who could help make this happen. @BrendanSchaub @novogratz @sherdogdotcom if I win the Presidency I’ll make sure it happens.  I want to feel good about following the sport and I know many others feel the same way.  #evolutionisnecessary
I say this as a longtime @ufc fan who has had a harder and harder time justifying it. Every other major sport has a union. If MMA is supposed to be the next major sport, it should too. Might even draw better athletes and grow. Until then fighters will continue to get shafted.
By ‘leaving them out to dry’ I mean ‘leaving them to retire early into poverty and injury while Dana White pretends to give a sh*t about the next fighter.’  Endeavor should know their valuation is built on an exploitative labor arrangement that will end badly.  #mmaunion
@danawhite made his money.  Should be sharing it with the people who have left it in the cage for him over the years instead of leaving them out to dry.
I think the roots are in our educational system which takes some of those prone to alienation and pushes them further to the margins. Greater individualized learning would help in many cases I believe. That’s a long-term approach - short-term you’re looking at hardening venues.
Sorry it’s necessary.  Gamed a lot in my day.
The shooting in Jacksonville is a terrible tragedy. We have to do all in our power to make it harder for this to happen, including investing in mental health, gun control and venue safety. These are dark times - and mitigating the unthinkable is unfortunately now a top priority.
Thanks Nicholas
Thanks Colleen!  👍
Thanks Mike
Kudos to @ginaraimondo for making this happen and leading the way
Have a plan for student loan forgiveness it’s much needed 👍
Thanks Jacob!
Have not and do not plan to.  👍
Need to get gains from tech advancement
Man I believed in Sweetney
Thanks Dan.  👍
Thank you Nicholas!  Let’s make it happen.  👍
Thank you Karen - hope to see you on the trail in Michigan soon!  :)
Of course Kai-Fu - it is a great book and a hugely important read!
Thanks Eli
Thank you Lynn.  Let’s make it happen.  👍
Thanks Garrett.  Would love that.  Been a @joerogan fan for years.  👍
Thanks John.  Really appreciate it.  👍
UBI would strengthen the Main Street economy and create accessible jobs.  4 million new jobs according to the Roosevelt Institute.
Will keep working for your vote Matt.
Thanks JC 👍
There is an approximately 98% chance of Daniel Murphy winning a postseason game for the Cubs.
Thanks Peter!  See you soon.
Thanks David.  Let's do it.
Thanks Ned.  Let’s solve the problems.  Good ideas can come from anywhere.  👍
Thank you Anne.  All true!  👍
Sometimes we go too far one way to go the other direction.
Thanks Luke.  Let’s spread the word.  👍
Hope so
I like these things too.  👍
Thanks Todd!
Happily prices don’t work that way.  Inflation has been driven by education and health care costs due not to consumer purchasing power but by other factors. If people have money firms still have to compete on price because people are still cost-sensitive and trying to stretch $$.
Thanks Nikhil 👍
Completely agree that the goal should be to protect workers and not jobs and that with better support mechanisms attitudes toward automation can improve. We have a long way to go.  👍
Low productivity growth is largely that we are pushing labor into increasingly unproductive pursuits and our labor market isn’t adapting.  Does not mean we aren’t automating jobs - the multi-decade low labor participation rate particularly among unskilled men is a sign we are.
No prob see you soon.  Let’s solve the big problems.  👍
Thanks Alex.  Let’s share what we know.  👍
@lisquart see you soon.  Ever true.
Thank you Diane!  So great to talk to you and your audience.
Inflation not driven by purchasing power (see education, healthcare) and many consumer goods getting less expensive.  Impossible for vendors to collude on all dimensions simultaneously - still price sensitivity among consumers.
Thanks Belinda hope you enjoy it.  😀
Haha great minds I guess Vivek.  ;)  Thanks for sharing brainwaves my friend.
Thanks Ezra.  Enjoyed the conversation a great deal as well - congrats on your leadership and clarity.  Look forward to sharing the road with you and Annie in the days ahead.
Luxury retail will be all right.  Always a need at the high-end.
We all start out needing other people and end that way too.  Relying on each other is entirely human - even during the times in-between.
Thanks Shaan.  Let’s do the work. 👍
Would stimulate new forms of work and create 4 million new jobs across the US.  Would enable much greater dynamism in labor market and would increase worker bargaining power.
Agree on Medicare for All being necessary.
We fetishize (certain forms of) intelligence in America today in a way that is corrosive. Smarts aren’t character or human worth. Neither is economic productivity (as currently measured by the market).  Pretending they are will ruin us over time.
I love markets.  We simply need new ones that reward different types of activity.  Our current monetary market is quite narrow in its determination of value.
Elon Musk interview is a reminder that we are all human.  Every single one of us.  Let’s start acting like we know it.
This time will require labor absorption at 3-4 times the rate of the Industrial Revolution which itself featured mass riots. We instituted universal high school in response.  Gov’t retraining doesn’t work. There is no real response on the table this time - let’s change that.
New jobs are coming but they will be for different people in different places with different skills in smaller numbers. The test is not “Will there be new jobs.” The test is “Will there be new jobs for millions of middle-aged Americans in their towns that require similar skills.”
Thanks Jane. Look forward to making the case in Iowa and the rest of the country in the days ahead. We can make the ideas and solutions real.
Nah I’m not that clever
The market gets the value of many things wrong: the environment, parenthood (esp. mothers), caregiving, arts, volunteering, infrastructure, preventative care, journalism, the work of women and underrepresented minorities. Technology will devalue most labor itself. We must adapt.
@FunnyAsianDude made me laugh out loud
Oh no.  There are too many of us being pushed aside.  Let’s do all we can to fix it.
Oh no.  Aretha Franklin is Forever.
Evelyn and I had a great date night seeing #CrazyRichAsians - hard not to enjoy.  Very fun movie!
Sane Poor Asians would do poorly at the box office.  (Enjoyed the movie!)
Not out yet.  But soon I’m sure.
sure
Thank you Dylan.  👍
Thanks for the great work Laura!  👍
@gazettedotcom
Past mismanagement doesn’t necessarily mean the money is not there.
Thanks Matt!  Great meeting you too - let’s spread the word.  👍
Coming soon
Thank you for having me!  👍
Or maybe an increase in military pay
Thanks Wayne 👍
Getting word out in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Reception here is tremendous.
Not yet 👍
I would believe in retraining if the data were better.  It’s part of the solution to be sure if all were to go well.  But we have to be clear-eyed.  👍
Thanks Brian.  This trip is jammed but appreciate the invite! 👍
I’ll likely gray up pretty soon.  Sita and I go back 27 years.  :)
Thanks Tim just tweeted 🤔🙏
More innovation with varied goals
Going for Human Capitalism
Every time I get a donation I look at the person’s address and what they do for a living. Just got a contribution from David, an architect in Rockwall, TX. Before that from Gary, an unemployed man in Southborough MA and Troy, an engineer in Blaine, MN. I appreciate every one.
It’s time to build a new Trickle-Up Economy from the ground up, from our people, families and communities up.  If we Invest in People we all win.
Scott is my hero.  👍🙏
The Big Machine is not what it used to be.  👍
Complicated but generally against it due to cost and difficulty of administration in a non-racist manner.
Right intention but I fear millions doing spirit-crushing makework for subsistence pay would be the result.
Thanks Annette.  Let’s make some real change.  👍
If the care work were paid and recognized it would be in GDP.
If we were to include care work, particularly that done by women, our GDP would be 26%, or about $5 trillion dollars, higher. “Society is getting a free ride on women’s unrewarded contributions to the . . human race.”  Universal Basic Income would help right this wrong.
Like you, we have to get people to think much bigger.
LeBron’s school will do more good in one day than Trump University did in its entire existence.
Human Capitalism is our shot at it.
True that Raman.
The inventor of GDP, Simon Kuznets, suggested that the work of mothers should be included in the calculation - and that defense spending should be subtracted.  He also said that GDP is a terrible measure of national well-being.  We need new and better measurements for the future.
You remember when the Mets were 11-1?  Oh well.

Raising the Floor by @AndyStern_DC
Thanks Kim!  👍
Need to pick up your book before we meet in Iowa.  👍  Have liked what I’ve seen from you.  Follow me on Twitter then we can DM.  See you soon.
Thanks John - look forward to exploring this with you.  Martin Luther King Jr. was also for UBI.  Has had support from all quarters over the years.
Fix.  👍
You tend to do more interesting work when no one is paying you.
Numbers say otherwise unfortunately.  My book goes into detail.
I think Annie is a good one - fan of hers.😀
Working on it
I like it.  Will likely take several approaches.  Money talks.  Have to make cost higher than benefit.
Need more good news
Single moms are superhuman
Society feels very punitive nowadays.  We could use more grace and forgiveness.
Society should also be free to support family units getting and staying together.  Data is clear it’s a good thing.  And it’s disappearing is a bad thing particularly when you take into account the lack of support for single parents.
I am for economic empowerment for women - Universal basic income would be GREAT for women and single mothers. Also for paid family leave, subsidized day care, flexible work arrangements and other supports.  As a parent I am blown away by how hard it is.
We should have paid family leave, subsidized day care, flexible work arrangements and universal basic income to make motherhood more manageable for anyone.  As a parent I see how tough it is and am in awe of anyone taking it on alone.
Support parenthood via parental leave, subsidized daycare, flexible work arrangements, universal basic income.  All would help people have kids and breathe easier.  Right now it’s tough for many people contemplating kids.
Thanks Becca - think gays lesbians trans should freely marry and adopt.  We need more love.
Very fair objection.  Our system is systematically anti-family: no parental leave, no day care, very little support for mothers. To me the directives of the system are clearly trying to maximize capital efficiency at the expense of other human priorities and values.
Japan is ahead of us in not reproducing.  Old people show up to jail for companionship.  It’s a sign of a society in decline.
Numerous studies have linked low birth rates to economic insecurity.  Same with marriage rates.  Economic insecurity is a product of our current system that is designed to maximize capital efficiency over other concerns.  It’s not designed for human well-being.
Women getting more economic freedom and opportunities very positive.  Declining birth rates and demolition of marriage not good for anyone - children’s outcomes worse, men die earlier, more women sole breadwinner, etc.
Not labor replacement but VERY helpful
VAT at half the European level + existing spending + cost-savings + revenue from spending growth
Thanks Dylan.  Means a lot.  Let’s go get some more.  👍
“You can’t use up creativity,  The more you use the more you have.”  - Maya Angelou.  The same could be said for a sense of humanity.
A deepening mindset of scarcity is overtaking much of the country fueled by pervasive financial insecurity. Too many have their heads down trying to survive. Things will get much worse as the malls close and trucks start to drive themselves. The answer is abundance and humanity.
Just got invited to speak at Cambridge.  Wish they could vote.
We are verifying ID for every single one.  If we can’t then we don’t accept.  The reporting for them will be spot-on.  👍
The entire framing of capitalism vs. socialism needs to change.  Most people realize that our current system needs to evolve to account for the destruction of middle-class jobs and ongoing automation + devaluation of labor.  The challenge is evolving to the New Capitalism.
Thanks Dutch.  Let’s make it real.
Thanks Rob.  Appreciate your support!  👍
Couldn’t agree more 👍😀
Yes need to give people ‘buying’ power.  Social currency best approach in my view.
Thank you Stephen!  Let’s share what we know.  👍
Yes need to exempt seniors or increase SS benefits.  Prefer the latter as it is unsustainable as currently structured.  👍
Thanks!  Your graphic novel looks incredible.  👍
Feel like it’s the most direct game changing policy that reinforces many other goals.  But I hear you.  👍
Avoid talking down to ppl.
I’ve found that among many people the brand of the Democratic Party is badly damaged.  That needs to change to win big and solve the real problems.
Thanks @wraycodesign !!!  👍
Thanks @LouFoglia great piece 👍
If we don’t have ID info for a donation we simply won’t accept it.
Thanks Neil - much appreciated.  👍
Need to get in front of global warming as fast as possible.  Existential-level threat.  Invest in renewables, geoengineering, curb development in certain regions and smarter infrastructure.  Different vision of growth.  More is not always better.
Thanks Raman.  Felt the same way.  #humanityfirst
I agree!  Let’s do it.
@shacheng @ecantor we are up and running.  👍
Thanks Masha you helped open my mind.  😀
Yeah Mike you made it happen!
Thanks Dan.  Will do my best to earn your support.
It’s just another currency - money is no less oppressive.
Thanks Nick - let’s take it all the way.
Thanks Steven pumped to work with you to move the world forward!  #humanityFirst
Or one could decide individually.
Awesome
Prices don’t work like that happily.  Still competition between firms and cost sensitivity among consumers.  Can’t magically lift prices without mass instant collusion.  Inflation right now isn’t being driven by purchasing power in education, health care, etc.
Thanks Jo.  Hope to meet next time I’m in Boston.
Certainly don’t intend to ignore anyone Albert.  Can disagree on merits of plans based on different approaches.
Thanks Daniel.  In SF this week if you’d like to get together.  Let’s open some eyes and minds.
Thanks Leah.  Look forward to sharing the journey with you!  :)
Think I have a realistic sense of the obstacles.  But we need to head in that general direction very quickly.  The opposite of utopia is fast approaching if we don’t get our acts together.
Thanks Harry.  Heard good things I hope.  👍
A jobs guarantee is a well-intended but terrible idea.  Leads to armies of dystopian laborers forced to do makework to survive amid a growing mass of bureaucrats.  Studies have shown an inability to transition into private employment afterwards.  Need specific goals to achieve.

Maybe ask in person?  In Seattle next week.
Still competition between landlords and tenants can move more freely because income not tied to location.
I guarantee that if kiosks replaced zero workers we would see far fewer of them.
Much in common with different policy emphasis.  Very similar goals and principles.  👍
We will connect soon for sure 👍
Not regressive if funds put into people’s hands.  VAT or something similar increasingly necessary over time in my view.
Thanks Tim.  You see it more clearly than anyone.  I share your concepts of Supermoney and Master Market Intelligence all the time.  Let’s change what must be changed.
Working on it
Working on it 👍
Thanks!!

Nah 6 feet or so.  Lincoln’s title is safe.  😀
No.  Opt-in so anyone who wants to keep their current benefits is untouched.  👍
Thanks Dan!
We need to build a Trickle-Up economy from the people up.  Put money into people’s hands.  We know that would work.  Pushing money to institutions and hoping it filters down to people is a waste of time.  A new economy is needed that puts Humanity First.  Let’s do it.
Yes.  Unrealistic for many.
Thank you Raman - you are the best.  Let's show what we're made of my friend.  #humanityfirst
Running for President is invigorating - you actually feel stronger when you get support from other people, like Antaeus when he touched the Earth.  Appreciate every bit of support.
I like it Eugene 👍
Yes trying to make it happen in Pittsburgh in the Fall!  👍
And thanks for the support!!  😀👍
Ever true Andrew!  👍
Thanks David let’s take it all the way.
@RayDalio couldn’t agree more let’s change it and rise to meet the challenge
I find strict originalism narrow and unproductive.  The framers of the Constitution could not have foreseen all of the issues and society of today.  Evolution is positive and necessary in most things, including hopefully our system of laws.
Thanks Vivek.  Indeed much work to do.
We also need to move to 18-year terms for Supreme Court justices as opposed to lifetime tenure. Having laws change because of the health of an 82-year old is bizarre. This way every President would get 2 appointments.  Would make for steadier government and progress.
And Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh seems . . . Terrible.  Wrote the Starr Report and is a Scalia acolyte. Also relatively young at 53.  Hope the Dems fight this the same way the Republicans sandbagged Garland.  Fair is fair.
Thanks Tony hope to see you Friday!
If Universal Basic Income is inevitable we should be fighting for it right now.  Would alleviate untold human misery and provide time to adapt.  If we wait too long - likely disintegration.  Let’s do it now.
People like to argue the hypothetical rather than the real.  It's a disease of this time.  We'll make it real soon enough.
Thanks Bobby - look forward to fighting alongside you in the days to come!  Let’s show what we can do.  👍
Thank you!
Polling support numbers nationally and in early states 👍
You wouldn’t.  👍
Sorry about that!!
Yes - will be generational challenge.  We need to get after it immediately.
@scottsantens
Agree.  Lyoto Machida my favorite for a long time.  They all can’t go out on top like GSP.
DC beating Stipe like that stunning!  DC versus Brock Lesnar will be must-see.  I grew up on pro wrestling - my Dad thought it was real - and then did martial arts for years.
Thanks Mike!  👍
Thanks Ryan!
No prob 👍
Went on Fox already more to come
Thanks Christy.
If elites leave the US it will be because of a retrograde dysfunctional government and disintegrating society - not because of a functional state and taxation system.
Much to like!  👍😀
Biggest market in the world.  Best high end education and services.  Other major societies have higher VATs and taxes anyway.  Inertia.  Patriotism.  After you have a certain amount of money it doesn’t touch you day-to-day.
Thanks Rachel!!  👍
I know tons of young people who are not having kids because they feel they can’t afford them.
Completely agree
Thanks Andrea!
Still competition between firms and price sensitivity among consumers. Vendors can’t all raise prices without mass collusion.
Thanks Jordan.  Appreciate the support!
Thanks Joey!
Thanks Erik
Thanks Tara 🙏 much work to do
Thanks!  👍
Ha thanks
Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries.  Without them humanity cannot survive. - The Dalai Lama
👍thank you!
Universal Basic Income would create 4.6 million new jobs happily
Thanks Hannah!  Will try to stay there.  😀
Thanks Frank!  Congrats on the work you’re doing for @TheDemocrats let’s do it
Nah.  Anyone who spends time with me knows that one of my primary concerns is displacement of labor male and female alike.  Universal Basic Income should obviously be universal.  I do like how this highlights how positive UBI would be for women though.  Would help us all.
They do what they are doing now with greater economic mobility
One woman said to me recently “Never before have so many women gotten together to ask for so little.”  Economic Freedom would help women walk away from exploitative and abusive jobs, bosses and relationships. Universal Basic Income ought to be a foundational issue for women IMO.
From what I can tell we are moving many of our high-IQ types into repetitive intellectual manual labor.  Not sure it’s really driving as much value as we would hope.
If you read the essay you see the point.  Many truck drivers will work very hard up until the day we make their jobs obsolete.
Hoodies are actually quite practical in SF.
The Warriors are officially the least rootable team in the NBA
August
Thanks Amir
Thanks!!  👍  I know it.
Journalist titled that
Thanks Chris.  You see it clearly.
Parts of ICE do serve useful purposes (e.g. fighting counterfeits).  Understand spirit of abolish ICE movement though - outrage can lead to good things.
Nah journalist did
Much work to do agreed.  Focus of education should change.  More vocational less college as the end-all-be-all.
This Lakers roster is like LeBron’s vanquished enemies coming to join him.  Paul Pierce should come out of retirement.
Data very encouraging on this.  Lack of money doesn’t discourage drugs.  Other way around.
Less fraught if regularly scheduled and expected
Yes but must spread benefits more broadly and quickly
“Until we are all free, we are none of us free.”  - Emma Lazarus
Hope to get to NC soon!
Election Day should totally be a holiday.  Facilitates real democracy.
Congrats to the new class at @venture4america who are just starting Training Camp in Detroit!  You will do amazing things with the best people. 👍😀 @maxnuss @wbarryconrad @AmyNelsonVFA
Agree with this.  We are suffering from a government that passes on the responsibility of governing at every turn.
Thanks Tyler.  There is definitively a crisis of meaninglessness in my view.  Shows up in the numbers and in our lives.  Sorry for your family’s loss.  You’re not alone.
18 years yes
Thanks Scott.  Means a lot.  Appreciate the open-mindedness.  See you soon in NY.
Thumbs up
Term limits for Congress a good idea too.  Something wrong with legislator who wants to hang out in DC forever.
The fact that the law of the land hinges on the continued health of an 82 or 84 year old judge is bizarre.  We should adopt an 18-year term for Supreme Court Justices.  New appointment every 2 years.  Would steady the course of government and society.
Need to strengthen Social Security.  Different plan.
Yes but all money going into consumers hands.  Bottom 92% of adults get more purchasing power.  May need exemption for or increased benefits for 65+ group living on Social Security.
In principle yes.  In fact printing $1.2 trillion in an economy of $19 trillion might not cause much.  Printed $4 trillion for banks in bailout without much inflation.
The numbers are a bit lower because it stops at 64, current spending and revenue from economic growth.  But yes you could pay for it with a VAT at about half the European level.
Agree.  Just suggesting we should broaden our focus to include outside of school.
Suggesting institutional and philanthropic focus on schools and teachers misses opportunity to address majority of issues that fall outside school walls. Hard to make progress focusing on 25% of the problem. Real progress would likely require more holistic approach. Including UBI
I’m calling it now - LeBron James and a bought out Melo meet up in LA on the Lakers.
I believe it
About more money to families not less for school 😀
Thanks John.  Means a lot.
Thank you Ben!!👍 Really appreciate your support!!
Thank you - let me know what you think.  👍
Thanks Manjula!  👍
Yes - may need to exempt current beneficiaries from VAT or increase benefits.  Would consider progressive consumption tax as you suggest.
Keep in mind money going into consumers’ hands.  Comes back to companies.
One reason VAT better than income or wealth tax.  Gains from progress and consumption more broadly and not really other individuals more systemwide.
Haven’t released data so hard to say.  Small grants to selection of unemployed not quite UBI in any case.
Thanks Dan!!!
Thanks Bill!  Really appreciate it.  👍
Thank you Clayton!!
Thanks Jared!  Much appreciated!
Thank you Michael!
Amazing
Incredible thanks Jamie!  🙏
Thank you
Thank you Casey!  Agree it’s the only answer.
You too Jamie.  We all need to do more.
No.  Still competition between firms and cost sensitivity among consumers.  Vendors can’t magically collude.  Increased purchasing power doesn’t drive inflation in the way you describe.
All previous implementations have shown no decrease in work hours with exceptions of teenagers who graduate at higher levels and new mothers.  Data is very positive.
Thank you Colleen!
UBI for now 😀
UBI would help support retail.
No limit.  Everyone gets it.  Truly universal.
Thank you Jamie.  My voice has now accompanied you for hours.  ;)  Appreciate the support a great deal.
Thanks Thad!
Thanks Chris!👍
Thank you Marianne!  👍
Tell your American friends 😀
Thanks Josh!🙏
History is rough.  One reason we must win.
Thanks Eric.  See you soon.
Agree
Thanks Jenny
Or my mind works fast
FEC regs make it tricky.  Wish I could simply say ‘Yes’
East easier
Hope to get Green support.  Think Dems need bigger better solutions that improve people’s lives.
No prob Neal.  Appreciate your support a great deal.  👍
Taking every opportunity I can to get the word out.  Agree that people are receptive.  Just need to reach more each day.
😀👍
Thank you Briton!  🙏  Let’s change it for the better.  Hope to be in Atlanta soon.
If we sit here and wish for Americans to will themselves off of drugs we will be waiting for a long time.  Unproductive.
I’m a serial entrepreneur.  I love personal responsibility.  That includes for our leaders who are meant to not push addictive opiates to millions of Americans.
Only if we clean up campaign finance.  Job #1.
For alternative meds for sure.  France cut overdoses 79% in 5 years with buprenorphine.
It was caused for money.  Profits of billions for Purdue Pharma.  Cleaning up an oil spill isn’t cheap.  But obviously right thing to do.
I’m for making buprenorphine freely available.  But the issue is reversed.  There was no personal responsibility for the family that made tens of billions pushing addictive opiates to millions.  That’s the real crime.
Sure.  Still need lots of people getting prescriptions to reach that level.
Thank you Rich.  We need to evolve quickly.  Would love your help.
Thanks John.  Let me know what you think.
Thanks Josh.  Great meeting with you - it's going to be people like you who lead the way and help others realize what is possible.  Look forward to sharing this fight with you.  #abundancewillwin #humanityfirst
Very much so.  Too much at stake not to be.
Thanks Victor.  🙏
Thanks Rich.  We can make that world happen.
Very similar - but SSI requires disability (i.e. can't work without losing benefits).  Goal is to provide benefits but free people up to volunteer or work part-time if they want to.
Prefer UBI for administrative and cultural reasons but would love a negative income tax
Thanks for the heads up
Thanks Henry.  👍
More data always welcome.  I’m sure that the economy would grow and jobs would be created based on previous trials and Alaska and common sense.  Question is only to what degree.
Thanks Adam.  We definitely need to push the envelope socially as we are lagging behind the technology and the gap is growing.
Hope you enjoy it Anne
Would need to research the numbers up north.  But you all already have many more pieces in place (healthcare, public education, VAT) and a history with UBI.
Haha not like that Dutch.
No prob!!  😀👍
Thanks Dan.  Let’s make it happen.  👍
Not sure if you noticed the bailout issued $4 trillion to banks.  We have more flexibility than you think.
No plans yet but would love to visit with Bill.  👍
Many jobs available for years to come particularly in middle-skilled jobs that require technical or vocational training.  Always will be a need for high-level creative thinking too.  Non-routine manual and cognitive jobs will be with us for decades.
Thanks Brady.
No prob 👍😀
Increased citizen purchasing power is not driving unaffordability of healthcare, education, and housing.  Those markets are distorted due to principal-agent problems, govt subsidized school loans, zoning regs, etc.  My book goes into this. Increased purchasing power will help.
In my view the best shot at real change is a transformation of the Democratic Party. The mechanics are ballot access but also donations and media treatment at every stage.  Most Americans would struggle to name a minor party candidate. Jimmy was a Dem for a long time for a reason
Got 1% of vote and low visibility.  We are going to have to do much better.
Thank you Elle.  Always learning.  ;)  Best of luck to you as well
Still price competition between firms and landlords and cost sensitivity among consumers.
Would love that Wayne.  We have reached many of the same conclusions.  Let’s connect!  What’s the best email for you?
Saw Molly’s Game last night with Evelyn and enjoyed it immensely.  That and I, Tonya were great movies.
Stronger if I have a chance to win 😀
Times change technologies change and unprecedented things happen.  The numbers are clear and stark.
Mechanics make running as an Independent nearly impossible - hence Bernie as Dem, Trump as Republican, etc
Unfounded - still price competition between firms and landlords and cost sensitivity among consumers.
Thank you Robert.  Let’s do it.
Last night’s draft also pointed out how irrelevant the Knicks are.  They will be one of the worst teams in the league next year.  At least they are still paying Joakim Noah $18 million.  Thanks Phil Jackson + Dolan.  #rebuildingforever
Still price competition between firms and cost sensitivity among consumers.  Can’t gouge unless everyone did so.
The digital social currency would likely be on the blockchain.
Yes.  Goal is to build new economy with new social currency that allows for anyone to participate and grow.  But this is a real challenge.
Thank you Alex
More people are catching on Alex.  Lay people just need to feel like it's possible and then they will get on board in record numbers.  We just need to make it real for them.
Thanks Michael.  Hope you're doing great!  Let me know what you think.
Thanks Mike.  You know more than most anyone what is on the horizon.  Let’s share what we know.
Much we will get wrong for sure. But general direction is right. The data indicates that we are already seeing the things you would be most concerned about - displacement and low labor participation, polarized jobs, regional inequities, opiates, disability, suicides, despair.
Would enjoy that.  How best to reach you?
Nah
How is Luka Doncic not the consensus #1 pick in tonight’s @NBA draft?  Dominated adults as a teenager.  Feels obvious.
Below a certain amount ok.  Getting email addresses from most everyone.  👍
Good ideas and patriotism don’t rely on party affiliation.  👍
Thanks Brian.  Room on the bus for all.  👍  Let’s get to work.
Thank you Jenn!  Appreciate it a great deal.  👍
Yes blockchain part of the solution.
Thanks JD!  Great to have you aboard.
Thank you Geoff.  Means a lot.  Let’s share what we know.
Riding your bike across town at night is a great reminder that you are alive and mortal.
Thank you Don.  Hope to see you out West soon.
I know @dkhos.  He's a great man with tremendous values.
Most Americans realize that there is a problem and we need to do more to curb gun violence.
Gun ownership is an American right - but we need to enlist gun owners to help protect the public good, which includes curbing access to weapons that can kill large numbers of civilians, particularly by those who are more likely to do so (mentally ill, criminals, high-school age).
You have not been paying attention to recent economic history.  Work and money are no longer related for many.
Sorry you felt that way.  I try to address counterarguments and problems in my book.  Hope I was more successful.
UBI.  If we wind up with a NIT I could sleep at night.
Every major economy except for the US has a VAT.  All major companies know how to report and comply.
Ha agreed
Thanks Martin.  Learned a lot from you.
Note taken.  Thanks.
I hope so
The right spirit but some of his policies miss the mark.  Presumes an economy that no longer works the same way.
Not surprising
UBI doesn’t solve the entire problem- but it’s the first big step in that direction.
People still price sensitive and firms need to compete on price.  You’re certainly right about higher ed though.  This will create more alternatives.
No.  Still competition between firms and landlords and price sensitivity among consumers.  Very limited erosion of purchasing power.
Yes
Didn’t mean to ever suggest otherwise.  Hold nurses in VERY high regard.  Future of medicine.
If people have means to both support businesses they like and start them hopefully much more work would be meaningful.  I vastly prefer the market here too.
Likely a parallel system for the super wealthy where innovation would continue.
Yes they are different though they lead in the same general direction
Yes a negative income tax is a different version than a UBI paid for by a VAT.  I prefer the latter.
At this point most of the major rent-seeking is practiced by those at the top.  But the studies in various contexts are very encouraging.
Thanks Stephen.  Appreciate your support a great deal!  Let’s share what we know.
Thanks Josh.  Let’s go convince some others.  👍
@Jorge_Elorza coming your way today!
This is the real challenge.  Let’s get to work.
Your proposal was for $38k per adult.  Start a bit lower.  🙂
I like data.  Most studies over time have been very positive and impactful and were larger than many of the current trials which are often small, privately funded and not truly Universal Basic Income but limited cash grants to small groups.
Yes.  If we go too early we get more time to adapt and improve.  If we go too late it’s disastrous and possibly irreversible.  Hard to restore functionality and social integrity once lost.
Thanks for keeping an open mind.
Have a copy on my desk 👍
Sorry you felt that way Gareth.  I respect concerns about UBI.  I think you are referencing my sense that some people dismiss automation out-of-hand in a reflexive way that seems incurious.
Infrastructure and other major public works should definitely be part of the next set of great projects.
Universal Basic Income is small government.  Returns resources to citizens.  Has worked in Alaska which is a deeply conservative state.
We have all earned it.  People born to wealth didn’t earn their parents.  We are all citizens and owners of the richest most advanced society in the history of the world.
The blockchain has a wealth of potential.  Could make many things more secure transparent and efficient.
Thank you Sam.  Appreciate the opportunity and enjoyed the conversation a great deal.
Thanks Monica.  So glad you liked the book.  See you soon here in NYC.   Let’s make it real.
Yeah it was tongue-in-cheek.  ;).
@USBIG
Kawhi Leonard doesn’t seem great in forcing a trade.  San Antonio has been good to him.
Chapter 8 pp 77-79.  The measurements are independent - and when people leave the labor force it actually brings down the unemployment rate.
Thank you John - can’t wait to hear what you think
Coming to Atlanta for sure
Let’s change it for the better Andrew.
Glad you found us.  Will grow the tribe.  Definitely have our work cut out for us.  But growing every day.
Our institutions and leaders have failed us.  We have to do much much better.
I’m Gen X as well.  I can relate.
US is the goal
@Jorge_Elorza coming to Providence next week!  Would be great to see you - hit me up
Thanks Jonathan - let’s solve the real problems.
Heck yes.  Thank you Andrew - let’s solve the immediate problems that are tearing us apart.
And overdue!  😀
Yes American Pie and Scum.  I wonder if they still play American Pie today?
Still introducing myself - may shift over time.
Thanks Evan let’s take it all the way
It’s obviously impossible to shut down a mass transit system for years to overhaul it - one main reason we patch existing systems so much.  Fun to think about the possibilities that could exist otherwise.
A system can be amazing and effective and yet still benefit from some imagination.  Patching that system over time will become unproductive.  Many of the component manufacturers of some of the original systems have disappeared so now they have to custom build replacement parts.
@CTYJohnsHopkins @CTYalumni would enjoy this.  I was at Skidmore 87 - 88 Lancaster 89
Not mine!  She is a Yang though.  ;)
Bose
It turns out noise-canceling headphones are amazing.  Thanks Dad.
I very much do John!!
The Warriors are so dominant it’s scary.  LeBron’s options are limited if he wants to beat them - Boston, Houston, Philly.  Hard to see running it back with the Cavs ending differently.
Nah just making a point
Excited to watch LeBron’s last stand tonight.  Can he make this a series?  I hope so.
Totally agree
Kate Spade news is an awful tragedy.  Depression and mental illness know no boundary - we must invest much much more in both a culture that recognizes and doesn't stigmatize personal struggles as well as treatment and resources for people who are suffering.
Some leaders say that jobs won’t disappear because they give meaning to human life. But the market isn’t driven by what’s best for people—it’s driven by profit. If money can be saved, jobs will go. We need to build a new kind of economy in the face of advancing technology.
Thank you Maxime!  Much appreciated.
Congrats Howard Schultz on being one of the country’s truly great 👍 entrepreneurs and building a world-changing company @Starbucks.  More building awaits you.
Thank you Linda!  Pumped for your support.
Well if @KingJames brings the @cavs back and wins his 5th title he truly would surpass Jordan as the GOAT.  So if that’s the plan it’s going great.
Thanks Andrea - appreciate the support a great deal.  ;)
Not me!  See you soon though
Thanks Romeen!  Means a lot.
Nothing humiliating about a Dividend.  All shareholders get them.  We are the owners of this society.  Time to think and act like it.
Thank you Valerie!  So glad you think so.
Need them both.
Thanks Jake.  Let’s make it happen.
We are heading toward economic disintegration now due to automation and advanced technologies - better to bet on ourselves than to let it happen.  #HumanityFirst
Man that loss hurt.  Cavs had a shot at the end of regulation.  Almost stole one.
Thanks Lewis - much appreciated!  Where are you based?  Would love to meet up.  Congrats on all your work.
Thanks Hawk.  Time to wake people up and fight for the future.  Let’s get that boot off of people’s backs.
Thanks Michael hope you enjoy it.  We have a lot of work to do.
Great suggestion thanks!
Rick Grimes is quitting the Walking Dead about 4 years after most of us.
And it’s Warriors - Cavs for the 4th year in a row!  You have to think the Warriors are going to win their 3rd title in 4 years.  Going to be fun to watch LeBron try to do the next-to-impossible.
Holy cow it feels like Houston may take the Warriors spot opposite LeBron in the Finals!  On a roll at home - the crowd will be with them the whole way.
I think it’s a government issue given the scale and generalized need.  Corps and CEOs can lead the way though - will lead to much better outcome.
The party needs new ideas and energy.  Let’s provide.
I completely agree that a mindset shift is necessary.  Impossible to shift mindset without meaningful new resources for people in the day-to-day.  They will go hand-in-hand.
That’s certainly much of the issue - we need to make firearms much harder to get for troubled adolescents in particular.  Need responsible gun owners to step up.
Never should have doubted the King!    Back to the Finals for the 8th year in a row.
LeBron may be the GOAT but I don’t think even he can win Game 7 on the road in Boston with this team with Kevin Love out.  Hope I’m wrong.
Would be awesome if they went someplace that they’d be transforming and growing for the better
Great to hear
No problem.  Got to do what’s right.  We are still human.  @novogratz
I’m a serial entrepreneur with my eyes open as to what’s going on in the economy.  It’s not like the truck drivers are about to get dumb and lazy overnight.  It’s that my friends in Silicon Valley are about to get trucks to drive themselves.  I’m a Human Capitalist.  Wake up.
No way LeBron goes out at home.  This is totally going to 7 games.
I thought Harvey Weinstein would hide out in Tahiti or someplace forever.  So glad he’s back and turned himself in.
That’s because the buyers overpaid and levered up on debt based on an exploitative labor model that would keep costs low.
Feels like Celtics - Cavs goes to Game 7.
The @nfl saying it can fine teams for players not standing during the American Anthem is the wrong direction.  Gives teams incentives to discipline players.  Players should be able to express themselves and their beliefs.  The substance matters more than the show.  @Kaepernick7
Yes fighters are fighting for free in many cases when you factor in their expenses.  Plus health risk and no benefits.
Humanity is now secondary to capital.  We need to make capital serve us rather than the other way around.  And not shaft people who are risking life and limb in short careers.
Yes to @LeslieSmith_GF being the truth!
Thanks Craig.  Means a lot.  I’d feel much better watching UFC if the fighters weren’t getting exploited and oppressed.  It’s messed up.
Single-payer healthcare would help a lot.
That Rockets win on the road against the Warriors was something else.  W’s have been unbeatable at home.  I figured Warriors in 6.  Now?  Game 5 winner wins it all.
Thanks James.  Appreciate the friendship and support!
Everything they do is newsworthy.  Reaching people not an issue.
This Obama - Netflix deal makes me sad for some reason.
It’s true.  They have a chance.  If they lose tonight though it’s over.
Yes I agree.  Incentives are different though.  Going to take people from all sectors.
Holy cow LeBron’s 7 straight Finals appearances may be coming to an end.  An era is passing.
Haha you are my role model Cecilia!!
Agree with you Shyamal.  Need to get there.  Need to bring them something first.  NH recipient gets selected in Dec.
When I hear a crying child I think “not mine.”  Then I exhale.  Though they’re all ours.
This Warriors team is so nasty it’s like Amazon Google and Facebook all teamed up to compete against other companies.  Makes even good teams look futile.
I feel like the Rockets need this game.  If they lose home court against the Warriors going to be tough to come back.
Thank you Cory!  Really appreciate it.  Let’s grow the tribe!
Thanks Zack.  I’ll be there in due time.
LeBron is the greatest but the Celtics are making the Cavs look old and slow.  Going to be a long series.
Thank you Lauren!   Please spread the word!
Thanks Jim.  Let’s wake people up.
Capital maximization has clear incentives.  Humanity is secondary.  This is what we must change.
We need automation - but we also need its benefits spread more broadly.  It will ensure that we can continue moving forward over the medium and long-term.
Buffet lunch -the original job displacer.
Yes it is!  I love it too!
The Karate Kid was my favorite movie growing up.  Someone should totally open Cobra Kai dojos in real life.
Thank you Greg - appreciate this a great deal!  Meeting with Christian entrepreneurs this week.  We have so much work to do.
Love it - may be more direct path to goal
Let me know what info I can provide Rod!  Thank you for your attention and patriotism.
Thanks Brian.  Appreciate your support a great deal.  Let’s share what we know.
Thank you!  That’s amazing.  Hope to meet on the path forward.
Thank you Simon.  Would love your help spreading the word!  Let’s make it real.
I feel for Matt Harvey.  Hope he bounces back where he lands.
Experience is the best teacher I think.  That and role modeling.  We need a revamped education system that’s for sure.  1 step at a time.  I like TVs too.  ;)
Our education housing health care costs all out of control.  Money goes less far than it should.
Thank you for this Jerry!!  So awesome.
Thanks Jerry!  Hope to meet soon.  We need more art in the world.  Let’s make it so.
Thanks Christopher.  Doesn’t take much to recognize that Leslie is doing the right thing and getting shafted for it.  Humanity first.
Back to nyc this am.  Catch up soon!
Back to nyc unfortunately.  Love to catch up.
Feel better!  I saw a chiropractor for that and it helped.
Hope to be back soon!
Leave minimum wage to states but universal basic income makes it much less necessary
Thanks Maria!!  I appreciate it and you a great deal.  😀
Exactly right.  We are living it.
Need to try multiple approaches.  Problem very advanced now - slowing the pace just pushes the date back incrementally.
Thanks Chrissy!  Glad to hear it and hope to get there
We need to strengthen Social Security so it truly provides for citizens’ basic needs.  Can exempt from VAT or increase benefits.  I’m for means testing benefits to improve solvency.  I have parents too.
Yes let’s do that
The Cosby verdict is decades overdue.  If there is an emblem of how hard it is for women to be heard it’s the fact that it took this long to throw Bill Cosby in jail.  Progress.
North and South Korea heading toward peace is the greatest news we’ve seen in eons.  Cause for celebration on an epic scale if this process continues in a positive direction, which I believe will happen.  Great for humanity.  My sister-in-law’s family lives in Seoul.
That’s what we need to change
Thanks John much appreciated.  Working to solve the problems.
Thank you!!  Let’s make it happen!
Thanks Robert let’s make it happen
I think taxing ‘robots’ much easier said than done.  Would need to be very high rate to get to meaningful dollars.  Tough to target and measure without huge distortions.
Deficit is a time bomb I agree.  Been mismanaged for decades.  Aim to fix it.  I believe Freedom Dividend will allow us to rationalize costs.
Not the goal and certainly would not curb opportunities hope to create them
I agree with that prescription
Will work for some but not most.  Underemployment of recent college grads in US is 44% according to New York Fed.  Success of gov’t funded retraining very low.  We are very bad at this by the numbers.  Can’t talk ourselves into results.
Only one way to change that Joe.  Humanity depends on our success.
Thanks Dan please do spread the word
Will do!  What’s the best contact info for you?  Let’s do this thing.
I love this.  Student loan forgiveness!  Let’s get some people together!
Yeah I love Ohio.  A few people there know me.  ;)
Me too Saira!  We are fighting the same fight for the same people.
We need to amend and strengthen Social Security to provide for seniors.      We’ll get there.
Thank you for doing the real work!  So impressive
Keep in mind that this VAT is designed to put money into people’s hands.  Purchasing power will increase because of where the money is going.
Citizens only.  Though I’m for a path to citizenship.
Thanks David - lets do it.
It’s true we have made bigger moves for the banks without concern of how to pay for it
The @Mets will never lose again.
Will be there soon!!  :)
Nah I’m more into human beings
Take guidance from people who offer it.  ;)
Thanks Ryan excited for you to learn more.
Thanks Chelsea - we need to start putting people first.  Congrats on all you do.
Excellent!  Hope to meet in the days ahead.
Not the way it works.  If it did than any income increase would be constantly eaten up by price increases.  Still competition between firms.
Thank you!!  😀
Thanks Jeramiah let’s show what we can do.
Thank you for producing this @just_shelter you are making us stronger
Automation of jobs
Yes I do!  Let’s make it happen.
Thanks Will.  Let’s make it real.
Funded by real people
Every other industrialized country has a VAT.  Raises prices at the margins but competition still exists between firms.  Your argument ignores the fact that wealthy consume more and that money goes into the hands of others.
Thanks Robert - let’s share what we know.  Hope to see you in NH.
Definitely right about my parents ;)
Absolutely.  Universal Basic Income would support local farming and food Co-ops in a huge way.  So much is driven right now by driving costs to the absolute minimum at the expense of food quality and sourcing.
Labor force participation rate at 62.9%.  Multi-decade low and a long way away from full employment.  Underemployment among recent college grads 44%.
Let’s make it real Chris
Too soon but we are hopeful.  ;)
There is with the other audiobook version.  Let me check.  Thanks!
Thanks Luis!  Let me know what you think!
Thanks Henry.  And thank you Gunny!
Yes!
Yes the audio book is available!
Thanks Valerie!  Can’t wait to hear what you think
Thank you Danielle!  Let me know what you think
Still competition between firms doesn’t increase money supply
Thank you Scott!  Much appreciated
Great - let me know what you think
Book launch party Wed night if you are free
Nice work @RichFeloni for reporting this deeply
Thanks Lawrence.  Let’s make it real.
You know I think the Mets are going to surprise this year.
Thank you Brittany!  Let’s grow the tribe.  ;)
Will head there soon!
Thanks Kenny.  Let me know what you think!
Anyone who believes Universal Basic Income is inevitable (which includes many technologists) should be fighting for it right now. Data says we are there. Would alleviate untold human misery. If you go a bit early we get more time to adjust. If you go too late - total catastrophe.
Thank you MJ!  Let’s make it real.
Thank you Barb!  We must make it real.
I like EITC - just like UBI more.  ;)
Past mismanagement does not mean the money isn’t there.  We need to reorganize the way value is distributed.  There is enough if we start being smart.
Kids seem to get sick a lot.
Would love that and look forward to connecting
FBI will never be infallible nor will there always be a warning.  Need to attack problem from all angles and try to lower incidences.
I agree UBI will change mindsets which will transform politics.
Thanks Anne - mine too unfortunately
It’s a sign of the times that massive protests are needed for common sense legislation on guns.  Our government is failing us due to its capture by small active well-moneyed groups.
New industries often push and push and grow and grow until something goes terribly wrong.  Then they get regulated.
Thanks Alison - you’re the best!  Let’s show what we can do.  :)
I’m here much of the time!
Appointed ambassador of entrepreneurship by the Obama administration Commerce Dept.  Started a national non-profit that has helped create thousands of jobs.  I have a clear vision of what is going wrong and how we can fix it.  We need to think much bigger and act accordingly.
Susan I am running for President on Universal Basic Income to address what you so aptly point out as solvable problems of needless suffering.  Let’s fix it.  Would love to work with you on this.
Yes it is!
I find myself loving the @CynthiaNixon candidacy.  Choice is a wonderful thing.  And the subway is indeed a disgrace. Congrats @ZephyrTeachout for leading the way.
This is one of the big challenges it’s true.  Valuing humanity and oneself intrinsically.
Let’s change that.
Thanks Jason.  Let’s fight for the future.
That’s right I do.
Pro-trade as long as we are smart about it.  On defense we need to focus on cyber and infrastructure.
Thanks Derek. Please spread the word.
Sure that’s one outcome best avoided
Thank you Sherrien- I am coming your way soon!  @quanphung
It’s becoming both more vital and more possible because of the spreading inequities and suffering.  The impossible will become inevitable soon.
Good idea thanks
April 3rd - I spent two days in a studio reading!
We have to broaden what we mean by work and why we do it
Todd is right - we need an entirely new economic structure.  Universal Basic Income is just the first and easiest plank.  After that it gets tricky.  ;)
UBI just part of the solution agreed.  Need more robust measures and solutions.
Schedule pretty packed for a bit
My pleasure Ty - look forward to meeting soon.
Hello Donna thanks for sharing your story.  It’s true we need big solutions ahead - and I hope to drive many of them forward and improve people’s lives.  You’re right that we need them in the worst way.  Hopefully we can make them real very soon.
Agree that over medication is a massive problem that is related and needs to be addressed - great point
You also don’t see hundreds of children and teenagers at police stations or adults with a completely distinct line of work.  Much more likely to result in accident or misuse than to serve useful purpose.
Arming teachers is the dumbest idea ever - it’s embarrassing that this is being considered as an actual policy response.  The obvious measures are to make guns much harder to get for teenagers and to invest in mental health screening and interventions.
Thanks Rachel - let’s show what we can do.
This era will force us to reflect on how and why we value people independent of our economic impact.  Will become moral and philosophical struggle - I hope we are up for it.
Thanks Brandon.  The future is now for many of us.
Thank you Li Mae!  Let’s take it to the White House.
“Get Yangry!” is my favorite so far.  ;)
Thank you!  Now let's spread the word and make it real.  Policies must evolve and fast.
I’m an Asian American parent with two children.  I have the feeling that I care a lot more about Asian Americans in college than the Republican Party does.  If they convince you otherwise than we simply disagree.
I support affirmative action across socioeconomic lines.  Asians are in an unusual position where we are overrepresented in many schools relative to our population but held to higher standards academically.  Diverse schools are a good thing.
I remember Jim - that was fun.  Glad you are thriving.  Please do spread the word on the campaign - let’s show what we can do.  Look forward to catching up soon.
Thanks Chris.  Tell them tech and politics are colliding.  ;)
Thanks Jay you led the way
Thanks Ana let’s solve the real problems
Thanks Tina really appreciate it.  Congrats on all you’re doing - we all need to do more.
Thanks Mark congrats too and hope you’re doing great!
Maybe invite a @venture4america Dartmouth alum back to speak!  I’m sure someone from VFA would help with that.
Stay flexible and define ‘real’ broadly - anything that touches customers is real.
@AndyStern_DC
Understand it enough to want to help Janelle
@AndyStern_DC your ears are burning
@AndyStern_DC
You seem determined to find negative impacts of a policy meant to deposit hundreds of billions in buying power for all Americans independent of any qualification.  Please assume generous intention.  Yes the poor get shafted most of the time.  Let’s change that.
That’s not how income tax operates.  Brackets only apply to incremental income impossible to wipe out earlier income.  Please dig in.
Goal is to replace income support where desired as an opt-in.  Medicare and housing left alone.   Our goals are aligned.  We all see the same needs and have the same vision.  Let’s make it real.
VAT could exempt certain things but some prices would rise - balanced by Freedom Dividend increasing purchasing power for vast majority
Social security untouched.  Food stamps recipients could opt in or keep current benefits.
Thanks Jasmine
Yes Kurzweil has influenced many of us a great deal
Sure thing love that direction
Thanks Joe I love that piece
Been a lot of mismanagement it’s true.  Possible to achieve multiple goals.  Greece didn’t have the world’s reserve currency nor our economic strength or diversity.
Existing programs + cost-savings + Value-added tax + carbon tax.  much more feasible and affordable than most think
Average or median worker.  Retail workers call center workers etc
Yes we have Dennis!  Thanks for thinking to put us together.  ;)
Hey @erikbryn can you dm me?  Have a favor to ask.  Thanks!
Let’s change that Theodore.
No Hell’s Kitchen
I have not seen Black Panther yet which makes me a subpar American and human being.  This will change soon.
Check my website or book.  You’ll see I’m all about innovation.  Even my funding mechanism is a VAT instead of a robot tax or something that would actually stifle innovation.  We need intelligent policy to provide a balance so that progress can continue and even speed up.
That’s exactly what I want.  Better policy to spread the benefits of innovation so innovation can continue and accelerate.  We need to head to Star Trek or we will wind up with Mad Max.
I’m all about the policy and distribution.  I’m not the least bit anti- progress.  I’ve been an entrepreneur for decades.  Stable societies are better environments for innovation than the opposite.
Obvious that progress will create wealth just as obvious policies are needed to account for massive changes.  There are no crude binaries.  Thinking that intelligent distribution and regulation is anti-innovation is simplistic.  Elon Musk just called for regulation of AI.
Happy President’s Day!  Hug your favorite presidential candidate today.
A journalist telling @KingJames to ‘shut up and dribble’ is like LeBron telling that journalist not to play basketball on weekends.  Ridiculous.  We are all citizens.
We’ll get there.  1st things 1st.  ;)
Believe in universal simply not meant to overlap with social security- will cover everyone until social security kicks in
Will get you a copy for sure.  Having events in NY shortly want to come?
Thanks Tim.  Let’s show them.
Thank you Jasmine!  Please spread the word!
Enormously pro-veteran - we need to not only support vets but put them in position to succeed.  It’s a moral imperative.  I will be pumped to work my heart out on this.
Great to hear it!!  Strong as an ox
There is no practical reason for citizens to have assault weapons.  We need to treat gun ownership as an awesome privilege and responsibility and regulate accordingly.  Guns are more deadly than cars and we take tests to get drivers licenses.
Very true.  Scarcity is eroding our humanity.  Universal Basic Income will be the greatest boon to collective mental health in history.
Mental illness is a scourge that can be alleviated through early intervention.  We underinvest in treatment and detection by orders of magnitude.  I will change that.  It will save lives.
Thanks Joseph please spread the word.  This campaign runs on passion and humanity.
Yes very similar.  Value-added tax.  Scott and I are friends.  ;)
Love it
Happy Valentine’s Day!  I wish this holiday seemed to have a higher joy-to-angst ratio for most of us.
All for lifelong learning and agree that basic needs first
People will always work.  Universal basic income will be the greatest catalyst for human entrepreneurship and creativity we have ever seen.
Thanks Jared
$1k per month per adult uniform across states
Thank you Paul.  One of my boys is neurologically atypical.  People who see things differently are awesome.
Will let you know!
Only if you want to hear me talk about how mma fighters need to be unionized in the worst way
Stick around we need you
Yes need to get in studio :)
Middle class Americans are struggling and will see $1k per month per adult as a major difference maker in their day to day lives.
Revolution much more expensive.
Point is UBI not as costly as one might think
Roosevelt institute estimated UBI would increase size of economy by $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million jobs if no tax increase.
Money flows push through to businesses and taxable activities and people get moved to higher tax brackets the govt gets some of the money back Rev to GDP ratio is 26%
Erik brynjolffson
The technologists closest to it are the most concerned.  Study history and you will see that these adjustments were often messy and violent and required massive policy changes.  This will be no different.  Innovations will continue have no fear.
Thank you @erikbryn look forward to working with you on this
Wow would love that.  Can get you some great co-hosts in Philly.  Pick a weeknight in March and we'll make it happen.  Pumped to meet in person.
Thank you Anne.  Sign of how dysfunctional our politics have become.  Let's solve some real problems.
Yes we are in touch.  Small world.
I’d love a carbon tax.  The Earth and humanity are tied for first as our fates are intertwined.
Innovation is great but will leave many behind.  Retraining not practical for millions.  Many technologists love progress but see the need to account for displacement.  I’m one of them.  Acknowledging disparities is not anti-progress.
Labor participation rate is 62.7%.  Underemployment for recent grads 44%.  None of this is speculative anymore.
Data on gov’t retraining programs shows them to be almost entirely valueless.  Wishing them to be effective is not a policy.
I’m a capitalist.  But markets won’t value untrained human labor at livable levels.  And education and retraining are realistic for only a low proportion.
If I were doing this to make money I’d be a total moron.  I get paid to solve problems not fabricate them.  Please assume generous intentions even if you disagree.  ;)
Thanks Zach.  Let’s do it.  We need folks like you who see it coming.
Thanks Kate!
Thanks Romeen - much appreciated!!
Thanks Greg.  You will always outrun me.  ;)
Thank you Lisa - you rock!!  :)
No disincentive to work with UBI.
Thanks for the support!
Thanks Khalil!  Let’s go get it.
Thanks Scott!  Means a lot.
Thanks Kelly!  Let's take it all the way.
Thanks Adam hope you like it more than you think.  ;)
This market pullback feels like the end of an era.
Fly Eagles Fly
You know our health care system needs help when 3 of our richest companies say “Ehh . .  . we’ll do it ourselves.”
Glad to hear it Sarah!
Yes that’s the right way to think about it.  It’s a necessary step for the technological and economic transformation we’re going through.  Hope you enjoy the book!
Let’s go Jaguars!
No developed country should have its government periodically shut down. The need for continuing budget extensions should be done away with by both parties.  Can you imagine a company saying “we’re closed because we couldn’t make a decision?”
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . . . from Norway.
Trickle-down doesn't work yet the Republicans keep trying it.  If you genuinely want to help people put money into their hands.
Who has the most money or clout is a bad way to determine who gets privileged on the Internet.  Hopefully Congress will do the right thing and pass net neutrality into law.
Thank you voters of Alabama.  Way to show that some things are more important than party affiliation.
I was on both a subway and the street near 42nd St. and I have to say that most everyone was just like, "Oh man, my commute is being messed up."  Very low fear or concern. Either resilience or people have become used to it.  People can get used to anything.
There are times living near Times Square feels highly unwise. Thank you first responders. Thoughts and prayers to the injured I walk that passage all the time.
Looking good Matt. ;)
Then I need to call the police
Apparently becoming powerful without becoming a creep is beyond the reach of a lot of men. Reason #257 for more women leaders.
Daylight savings time may be unnecessary but it feels good Monday morning
My son asked why there are so many new concrete barriers on the West Side bikepath. I told him it's a new obstacle course.
I ride my bike down the West Side highway most days.  Thoughts and prayers to the victims of this senseless and terrible act.  #NYCStrong
@felixgrays just saw your billboard on 11th Ave + 48th!  Looked amazing so proud of you guys @davidrroger @venture4america no more eyestrain

There's a section on Minerva in the book.  ;)
Thanks Mike
Thanks Carson
College athletes who are making money for their schools and the NCAA should be compensated - not doing so is exploitative.
Of course Chris - thank you for leading the charge.  See you soon.
Congrats @dkhos on the next big chapter.  If you do for @Uber what you did for @Expedia the world will be a much better place.
Wow @matthaggman running for Congress in FL makes perfect sense.  Burns with the public interest and will make an excellent Congressman.
Wow Kyrie to Boston for Isiah Thomas Crowder Nets pick.  That seems good for the @cavs. Rivalry just heated up
The events in #Charlottesville are beyond comprehension. Condemning hatred and insanity doesn't solve it. We have to build a better society.
Heading to 1st official @venture4america Alumni Reunion today at a campground upstate. Should be epic - ppl coming in from all over.
Apparently Bronn is a ninja and expert dragon breath avoider
@venture4america our pleasure awesome to see you grow
There's always @venture4america Reunion next summer #whatcanballcanneverdie
Thank you Mayor @Jorge_Elorza for joining us and inspiring the Fellows!  Providence is a better place for your leadership
Thanks Cecilia!!  You're the best.
Nah they love Luke Walton
I think it's a salary dump mainly
The Lakers really must not have liked D'Angelo Russell to trade him for Brook Lopez, even with Mozgov's salary attached.
Amazon buying Whole Foods makes me sad for some reason
The @NBA right now reminds me of today's economy - superteams taking all and parity a thing of the past.
Thank you Mike - and for being such an awesome coach and leader

Flying @united today and everyone has gone the proverbial extra mile. Reminder that orgs consist of lots of human beings trying their best.
If you overbook flights to save money, you should keep offering money to passengers to give up their seats until someone agrees to get up.
thanks Chris!  Much appreciated!
build things brother.  ;)

Arriving in Providence, the birthplace of @venture4america   If the mall had been here while I was at Brown I would have been a regular.
If you dig this headshot it was taken by the @WhiteHouse photographer.  #classy  He'll make anyone look good.
I really should have rejoined Twitter sooner.  I keep replaying the past year or two in my head . . .
Heading to Providence tomorrow for event hosted by @angusdav of @swipely for @VFAProvidence.  Excited to see everyone!
@garychou I know, I know.
(re)joining Twitter.  Hello all.
