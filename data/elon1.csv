Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
2 to 3 months after that
It *is* vision
I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months
Coming soon
Yes
This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space
No matter how one considers the data
Maybe end of next year
Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
Post test fuel leak
Aiming for hover test next week
Yeah
This non-Autopilot graph is not correct
Good piece
I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain & adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model 3P & then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!
Exactly. There is no “MSRP”
🍷 🚀 🥳
With anything online
Rococo Basilisk
🤣🤣 yes
Sure
Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots
Is there a longer edit I can post?
I think so
Something like this is the best way to do it. Incent outcome
About to go live
Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
Agreed
“If you dislike change
As mentioned earlier this year
Probably
Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Straw man fallacy. To appreciate
No
If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving
Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around 8pm.
Won’t be today
Sure
This guy is not a cofounder of Neuralink. Was at company briefly
!!
We are tiny
RIP
Um … yes
SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
Haha yes
Yes
Yeah
Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage
Initially
Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
Agreed
Ok
🔥
Also
Take note
About right

Cont of main
We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
Sure
Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.
Great team
It’s Not a Flamethrower
Sure
Exactly
Ok
Absolutely agree
Feeling extra 🍀 button
Done. I’m feeling 🍀 & I’m feeling 😋 navigation buttons coming with next software release.
Whoop Whoop!!
I think so. Will check.
🤣🤣
Would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other Tesla owners in the area
Sigh
Nice
I have over the years
No
That was a real sign
I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably
True
Exactly
No
No
There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming
This shampoo sounds amazing
No problem
The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
!freespace
May the light of consciousness shine bright
Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio
Exactly
Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
To be clear
Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload
Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios
Local supporters will be invited!
Yes
End of Q4
Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer
Starship Mk 1 & Hopper
Wārløq
Agreed
Later in life Bakunin is underappreciated
Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers
My D&D char was NG
Sounds like fun
Occupy Mars
👍
Exciting progress in Boca! Hopper almost ready to hover. Based on tonight’s test
Sharknado is real
When sheets come loose all dignity is lost
🤣🤣
Yeah
Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected
We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth & becoming multiplanetary via Mars. It’s not clear how much time we have to do these things
Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians & cyclists especially.
Should be fixed soon
✌️
Sure
Good one 🤣🤣
Not often these days. Good way to spend time with kids though.
Playing a little Polytopia. Gonna try Solaris w my boys.
Death Note
Yeah
Yep
Is this true @CGrantWSJ?
FWIW
Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion
Yes
Tweak music & car karaoke
Fun
Thanks for the happy birthday wishes! ♥️♥️
One day
Merkindise coming soon!
They have the best merkins
I’m such a bad public speaker! Damn.
These do seem like wise words
If only we’d listened …
💕
But
If you don’t already know what a merkin is
Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin 🤣🤣
We poured our heart & soul into it. Lot of hubris too
Hardly anyone noticed
We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
That’s actually kinda true
You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways
That was our design approach in early days
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also
Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges
Probably sooner
Ok
Sure
Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
High entry force & heat breached engine bay & center engine TVC failed
Ok
:(
Working on Tesla global logistics
I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
Yes
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
He was the real deal
One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
No
Colonizing Mars one mug at a time!
Waiting for Falcon Heavy to launch means high cortisol levels. This is our toughest rocket launch ever.
Yeah
Heat will breathe life into Mars
Absolutely
Yeah
Uh oh
Ok
On Mars
Chomsky is the Iago of socio-economic theory & Piketty is his docile puppet
Starship will do orbital launches from Boca Chica (near Brownsville) & Cape
At Cape for launch
Just watched it from your link ♥️♥️
Yeah
Yes
🖤 Tesla Software Engineering 🖤
All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines
It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
Yes
Same as last time
So cool
Anything with high contrast
Excessive shades of grey
Yeah
Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
Haha
Depends on destination
Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust
Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
More than that now
Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical
For sure moon 1st

A few other small things change
Tesla is putting significant resources into high-efficiency battery recycling. Makes both environmental & economic sense. Please consider joining if interested in recycling engineering!
No
Yes
We are the Von Neumann machines
Yezz
Exactly. And many areas of countries showing good Internet actually have poor or no access
One of my favorite original Roadster colors!
How about baby pink?
Changing the palette is hell on service
A simple white (not pearl multi-coat)
Starting next month
Will consider
This will be our most difficult launch ever
Original Star Wars
Probably fine. Some Tesla taxis in Amsterdam have 3 times that mileage.
Actually

Missed you too ♥️
Not sure yet
My chariot license is made of papyrus!
That’s the Tesla part
Overall master plan should be explained. I think it still makes sense if we don’t consider AI 2b other.
I’ve been tweeting strange shit since Ramses II. He was a great pharaoh!
Might get pushed to next month. Starhopper flight first. Waiting on engine repair.
Thanks 😀
Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.
By far
BG2 was so good
No need
The Ass Blade of Vengeance!
Weird that this actually happened. Music makes a big difference.

Don’t make me challenge you to a rap battle!!
Fair point
Yeah
😉
Thanks Bob! He is a tough critic.
“Not only was the paint without any discernible flaw

Haha
Would be good to look up electricity rates by location & optimize cost automatically
Yeah
Fun!
Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents
🧲 is relativistic side effect of ⚡️
Strong incentive to make up & promote negative news
True
🤣
Fear (and memes) get clicks
Storm Watch was active for hundreds of Powerwall customers this weekend as a result of @NWS Red Flag Fire Warnings in California
Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
Super fair criticism. We’re putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.
Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater
Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.
♥️
Yes
China EV subsidies mostly end this month & fully end in about 7 months
Yes
No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. It’s great to get thoughtful criticism.
155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels
Tesla Superchargers & service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
Yes
Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.
Exactly
We’re trying to simplify product complexity
Science 😀👍

Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
That’s the idea
🤣
Thoughtful model
Based on our data
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto & oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors & space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
Yeah
Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far
Not bad
Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
Yeah
I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
One day’s grace
Edgy move
Good idea
True. I’m a gamer & my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
Yup
Would love to do exactly that
Agreed
Exactly
Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
Yes
If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments
No
Fair
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
Propellant stays same
Whoa cool 😀
Yes
ISS is extremely gigantic & has lights
Precisely
Exactly
Karma ⬇️
Bold move
This is complete nonsense
Exactly. A car being electric & upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
It’s not my finest work 🤣
Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars
👍
Krypton thrusters operative
No
🤣🤣 Absolutely
Yes
Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps & elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
Yes
Exactly. Still
Paperwork & hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
LA has a subway
That would great!
Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!
So far
Ironically
Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
This is simple and just works
Pretty much
Krypton ion thrusters activate in about 3 hours to raise orbit
Thanks! Yeah
New S & X are much improved. Worth trying out. You’re on version 2
It’s smart *and* enhanced!
Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX
Part of the factory is being upgraded
Yes
Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
~2.8m
Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction)
Horizontally
First flights would have fewer
So it goes
3 months
Hopefully
Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.
Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe
Sure
Two tunnels about a mile long each
Yes
Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony
N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces & high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
Aspirationally
3 sea level optimized Raptors
After the GoT finale
Mk1 & Mk2 ships at Boca & Cape will fly with at least 3 engines
About to complete SN5
The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel
But
Yes
😉
Coming soon
Yeah
Physics favors full flow
Good design imo
Thanks Sam!
Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles
Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
Ok
Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
Yes
Almost ready. I’m testing it personally this weekend.
Yes
Also porting Unreal Engine
Nintendo won’t let us
Maybe so eventually
Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead
We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel & pedals!
Sure
Of course
Portal 1 & 2 on this would rock
Would be great to have @Roblox & @Minecraft!
Interact with games via touchscreen
It technically could
No worse than production of a gasoline car
Because a Tesla produces no emissions & filters most toxins
Yeah
Congrats on many successful launches!
√-1 2^3 3.14 😋
Set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small (sigh)
Physics demands the impedance of resistance
What makes resistance complex is that it’s half imaginary!
Glad it worked out
Congratulations @kitkitschool & @onebillion on creating great open source literacy software!
Starlink mission will be heaviest @SpaceX payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well
🏴‍☠️
That’s about right
Probably start installing end of next month
SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now
The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other
Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.
SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas & Cape Canaveral Florida
A lot
Exactly
It’s a factor
Technically
Happy Mother’s Day. I love you Mom!
Ok
Completely agree. Every Tesla should have good art & music creation software.
It is flat-packed. No dispenser.
That *might* not be my lucky 🍀 number
More details on day of launch
Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also
These are production design
If static fire 👍 on Mon
Ok
Exactly
Yes
Yes
Will try it

Sad if true 😔
When you read double standard articles about Tesla
Reality is a Tesla
Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths
Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays
Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣
Exactly. By end of this quarter
As a robotaxi
Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
Is that a real billboard?
We’ll let the NN loose on Track Mode one day … that’ll be insane
Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark …

That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
Thanks 😀
Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
I’m told it’s looking positive & we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
Impressive analysis
Only external cameras are being used right now
Also

Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct
Yeah
Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer
Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer
Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.

Best to get a Tesla Powerwall
Probably start Australia builds in late May or June & start arriving in winter
Coming soon
Yes
Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side
Only some of the hottest sections
Full size
We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica
Agreed
Raptor is *very* complex
Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow
Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off
First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
Goes against interests of all Texans
Wow
If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8
To be clear
Yes!
Definitely down the road
This causes some media confusion
Not exactly same time
Might arrive by June
Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor
Exactly! In fact
Still get this question a lot
About a minute in
There was something
It also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside
Would love to be there this year. If not
Exactly!
The hardest joke ever

Our “list” prices are our actual prices. Software (and automotive) vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate.
Sure
Sure
Correct
That’s the plan
Of course

In retrospect
However
We are still closing stores
When prices go down
Yes
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
Applies worldwide
Yes
Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week
Couldn’t resolve all the rights issues. Will add another racing game soon.
Ok
Yeah
Software release later this week should make it better

True (sigh)
True
Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon & Dragon
For cargo missions
Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
Most likely

Raptor on way to Hopper. Will be mounted to vehicle next week.
Thank you on behalf of the people of SpaceX!
All good
Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator
Atmospheric entry at 17
Yes
Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays & updated software with battery warmup results in >2X improvement in fleet charge time
We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America
So true 🤣
Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running
Yes
Ukraine did play a major role
Very little power & only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won’t notice it in range.
If you navigate to Supercharger
Thanks
You’re most welcome. Very proud of Tesla team. Super tough 15 years!
Oh stop
Ok
Yeah
Tesla comms is fixing. That was a mistake.
So cute!

Something like this could work
😉
Everyone knows Earth is hollow
Model S will be raised to 162mph too
Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also
Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph. Range on RWD 3 increases to 325 miles.
Yes
Spoiler alert: not Porsche
Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
Lightning bolt right before launch
Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isn’t perfect.
We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However
Will take a few days for system update
Yeah
It’s not exactly symmetric
If you bought enhanced autopilot
If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction
He is the sensor!
Nope
Happy birthday!
Yeah
Explanation from Tesla later today
Yes
Haha
Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months
Exactly
No reductions from here
For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
Should be ~5% peak power increase with March 15 software release
Scheduled for March 15 release
Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I was being too obvious
Make the Mars Technocracy real
Yay!
ET phone home. No answer 😢
Some Tesla news
Haha
Yes
California
Thursday 2pm
Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active
Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed
Yes
Exactly
Printers are too small. Also
Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin
Thank you Evelyn
Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect
SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript
Fate *loves* irony. Frankly
There’s a 🐜 in my 👟 🤣
Haha true
It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
Yes
Guys
Focusing on Starship instead
Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
Upper stage is flight
Including Heavy
Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday
High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise
Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
Yes 😀
Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
Advanced
SN2 has changes that should help
To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
Yes
Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse
Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable
Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive
You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
Essentially
We are constrained by the accredited investor rule
Yeah
That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok
Actually
Don’t know
SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD)
So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine
Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
That said
Won’t be long before they do
The gritty truth …
Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from @RickandMorty
Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
Pics are so clear in space!
That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
Also
I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
To clarify
It will soon
Yes
This is in addition to existing Cabin Overheat Protection
Yes ♥️ 🎼
It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then
Updating …
Wow
True
Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority
Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch 11 years ago
Bet the other carmakers didn’t see that one coming haha
Yeah
хаха офигенно
Starship & Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. Very important
Luke
Thanks Jack
Agreed
Sorry  Had a vital mission in Norway  Now I am back
True
Moon first
On my bedside table
A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way
The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
Very dependent on volume
Yes
This will sound implausible
Close
But not an extendable nozzle though
Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory
Yes
I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
About 11 secs
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today
Maybe tomorrow
Just left Zeebrugge
a
Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider)
Technically
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
Welded
The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth

Telekinesis
Vaporized some copper
Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
Sorry
We’re doing everything we can to get there. It’s a super hard grind.
Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact
💙 Mach Diamonds 💙
Glad you like it
Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners & main chamber
Will do
Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
We will when it rolls out
Yes
soon
That might be the ultimate superpower
I’m openly moderate. There
Haha how is this even real?
No
Exactly
I do like nonsense memes. It’s true.
Next few days
💩 looks like sentient choc ice cream
Whoa cool
No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
7
♥️ logarithms
Dammit! 😀
We’ll tweak the alloy over time
Well
Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Mostly true
Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation
Yes
Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
To be clear
Yes
Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced
Tasty food!
Super appreciate Deepak’s 11 year history building Tesla & wish him greatest of happiness in retirement! Zach has been outstanding over his 9 year history with Tesla & will build upon Deepak’s legacy.
Sure
You’re most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
Max Tegmark is great
3 guys standing on roof of skyscraper. 1st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off & is blown back on roof. 2nd guy tries & goes splat. 3rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman.

Great electric car documentary about early days of Tesla
We are so tiny
You drive a hard bargain
$5
It’s an honor
Ok
But

All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary & backup power to doors
Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by @Boeing.
Yeah
Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
So tempting …
It’s like looking in a mirror!
That would be so cool!
Yes
Rough beta in 2 to 3 weeks
Feature has now been in place for 8 months
These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
Sure. Also
💡😀
The youth love em
If test flight of 🐉 goes well next month
Actual tanks are fine
Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
Since it’s part of safety & security
Yes. Also
Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings & signs in each country.
untrue
Director of CERN asked me about Boring Co building the new LHC tunnel when we were at the @royalsociety. Would probably save several billon Euros.
Yes
Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups
Wow
Yup
Thanks
Yes
Order must occur before Feb 1
No
The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla & give them 6 months of free Supercharging
I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters
How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
Teslarati is very thoughtful & well-written
The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX & Tesla
The source info is incorrect. Starship & Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne
Haha you’re welcome! Hope you’re doing well.
Yes
We are not yet offering the mid range Model 3 in Europe
Ok
Obv must be more pointy tho
Haha
Should be done with first orbital prototype around June
Yes
Yes
Yes
This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller
Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the @SpaceX Texas launch site. This is an actual picture
Yes
Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
Going through final validation & regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. It’s trippy!
Yes 🚀
Def not
Yes
Starting on Monday
Good idea
It’s an option
Vertically or horizontally?
No problem
Plus
I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
I’m not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.
It will be
Btw
😉
Great thread 🤣
Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China
Aiming to finish initial construction this summer
Looking forward to breaking ground on the @Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory today!
Yes
Sorry
Spiral-winding is great for uniform thickness. We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel. However
Exactly
It’s all in the way you say it
I do love Tintin
More on this in a few months
Starship test vehicle under assembly will look similar to this illustration when finished. Operational Starships would obv have windows
Aiming for 4 weeks
Good shot of @SpaceX Starship flight test vehicle being assembled in Boca Chica
Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development & operational parts. First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California. Probably fires next month.
Haha
Not yet
That’s a reasonable question
Probably

Tesla team did a great job!
Yes
Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
Exactly
Yes
Congratulations
Coming soon
Yes
Got it 😀🇺🇦
Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers
Yep
Yes
Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA
We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities & working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
Ok
Wow!
This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery
Most importantly
And
There are also many state & local incentives
Merry Christmas & goodwill to all!! ⛄️ 🎄 🎁 🎅 💝 😀
No

Yes
Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
When it’s no longer noticeable over Planck’s length
Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
Engineering is true magic
Yezzz
How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities …
Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
Thanks!

Yes
I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies
Yup. Actually
While there are some material similarities
Stainless steel is correct
If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end

Join our underground movement!
Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels
Ok 😀💨
Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Exactly
The guides are basically just a wheel
Yeah
Probably only need three types: straight ramp
Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing
You’re right. We did have a sim ready
Pop up
I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.

Actually way more capacity
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
Yes
This can be applied to any autonomous
Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
Yeah
Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*
Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”

You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific
Also
No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
Yes
Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself
Probably next month
You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year
Probably end of next year
So true 🦙💩✨😴
This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer

The new design is metal
As far as we know
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time
Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant
We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
Yes
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled
Us too sigh
Falcon fairing halves missed the net
We’re adding police car
Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior
It is so hard to move in armor!
You’re all hired!
Yes … no … maybe …
Ok
Good advice
Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
Glad you’re ok
Perhaps most telling is that Norway

Rest in peace
Is he ok?
It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example
Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
Agreed
Makes me so mad when smart
That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies
We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually
Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
Good
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire
Fair point
Agreed
Cool
Yes
Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
No
Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.

Don’t worry
The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable
Exactly
We will enable track mode for all performance cars
It was underpriced. Anyway
Ok
Yeah
Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
Exactly. That’s Monday.
No
Isn’t it obvious?
Worth it
True
Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car

Massive thanks to Tesla owners & supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
Same
There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years
Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.

That’s next
I hope this is true!
If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason
Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
Model 3 long range
It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour
Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great
It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high
Just released lower cost
Week or two
Love the Reddit comments too
y
You’ll see
Yes 😀
New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
Yes
True
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
Thanks John
The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
I believe it’s $5k
~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
To be clear
This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments
Still a long way to go
Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now 😀
What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
Yes
Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! 45
It is time to create a mecha

Great. Also love Princess Mononoke.
Maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of Pokémon Go style game
Towelie 💗
Good idea!
Whole beer keg fits in Model 3 trunk!
Wow
Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
Maybe wise to bring it just in case 👽👾 😉
About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves
You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
Yes
Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change
Glad you’re safe
Beautiful picture
Yes
Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars
This is incorrect
Punctuality is not my strong suit
We’d be nothing without our fans
No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
It sure does. Very reliable.
You are right
You’re most welcome
Warms my ❤️ 😀

Fair point 😀
When something sounds too good to be true
Not all. However
V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
Only if they’re extremely tiny
We don’t judge. Any pic you want!
Rococo Basilisk is
The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
The big funds can & will
Debatably true
Where this breaks down is in passive index funds
There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts
I hope to be less wrong over time
You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
What they do should be illegal
The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
By revenue
People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products
If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows
Hang in there. If you are truly long-term
True
Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
Could be worse 😇
Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle
Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
i❤️🇨🇦
!! Will take action.
Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
What would be great is original Elite
Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
Increased tire pressure improves range. Also

Yeah … that’s exactly how I feel. However it happens
Thanks for helping fund a rocket & spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
Yes
Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied & this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
Very interesting

I was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned
V cool
So you actually did nothing & yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is @yoda.
Answer the question @yoda. You brought it up
At this point
Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?
It’s coming
You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself @yoda …
Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.
For the record
Sure :)
I want that outfit

Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes
Most major customers have tried it & love it. Now we need to finish production design & build it

This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen
What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles)

Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
Sorry
Yes
Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
Yes
No change
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
Yes
I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
Good morning 😀
Maybe Thursday

Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!

So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
Thanks Jack. To be clear
Actually true
Hold up a mirror & see if it fogs
I’m honored to work with an amazing group of people at Tesla
Safe to lick. I checked.
In a month or so
Will check with our cat
Spoiler alert. Next thing you’ll tell me is they don’t like pajamas.
Feels like a show & tell weekend. I wonder what the cat dragged in …

With my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of history
Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
Would love to. It’s been too long.
Prob early next year
Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy & vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team & potential for the future.
Sure 🌌 💫
Look
Just between us
The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
Sounds good
Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
It will happen for sure. Damn.
Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
Damn
Yeah
You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water
Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
For now
Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
Great move
Why sir … 😊
Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
Good point
Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters
Yes
Well … it looked smaller on paper
Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
Makes a lot of sense
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
Please lmk results of your water tests
When you’re there next week
Exactly
No
Already have
Ironically
Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments
Yes
Moreover
The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!

That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.

Can’t be too buoyant
Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work
Good idea
Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate
You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
Yeah
Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate
I would def recommend this
Interesting
Great
Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure
Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that
SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs
So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate
Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.

You’re probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
I’m at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It’s big.
They look beautiful
Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable & a great view of the mountains.
Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
They also poured the concrete & built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
No

You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
Then you’ll be fine
Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering
Then look a little closer
More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
How big is your short position? Just curious.
Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
I endorse freedom to form a union too
I’m not against all unions
I am too
Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon
Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly)

And I don’t trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of 2nd & 3rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.
Your math isn’t very good. Would require 61%. And what’s your issue anyway? Better suggestions are welcome.

My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother & I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption & wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure
Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
A socialist
Those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing

What is your utopia?
The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape & size of those streams.
Strongly disagree. I love humanity.

The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
Love this design. Simpler the better.
Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it
Yes. Hopefully
Will do
Correct
You have my word
Note
Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far
That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date
This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked

We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast & excellent outcome
Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
Yeah
And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit
No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon
Working on improving
No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean
Oh please
Coming soon
We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though
Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor

Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic
The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
That sounds like a fun adventure!
You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.

Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
True
You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description
Prob 8.3
Yes
All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature
“Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them
Yeah
Actually
Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations
Good progress. Really proud of this design & SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
Peace ✌️
Love the space cowboy esthetic

At risk of stating the extremely obvious
You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language & ad hominem attacks

Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
You’re missing the point & living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election & only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
You’re welcome to come by SpaceX

Because Twitter is fun
USAToday FTW!
Dank is wack unless you’re on weed
Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why
Yeah
The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
Pretty good. TinTin A & B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth

Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
Prob end of next year
Good point

You’re making my point. It’s tragic that there’s a national nano day. I wish I didn’t know that.
All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also
Worth a shot
Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
This is going to help journalism
Problem solved
I know
Something needs to be done to reward consistent
For some reason
Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews
I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
No
Yes
Wow
Done
Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
Amazingly
Ahem
Reddit is great
Come on media
Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others
I did to any who asked
That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ
Maybe after you get your Model 3
But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year
I just made that up
Gasoline or diesel?
What car do you drive?

Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now
Definitely
There no good car emojis. I mean seriously
Yo
That’s the basic idea
For some reason
I just tried to donate
Um
Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
Yeah
If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist
🤗
I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ
Of course
It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths
No
Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
That’s why editors are included too
We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score
Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
Not only needs to be botproof
Exactly
Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist
An exception that proves the rule
Uh
Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation
The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media
The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth
This will sound super obvious
I am not cool
The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me
Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔

Troll dead giveaways: not using real names
Great idea!
Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
But ya know what
In theory true
We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S
Good point
No
No problem
They are incorrect. We never met
Thanks again
I didn’t meet with him
I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid
Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated
To be clear
ABS calibration algorithm
Also
Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement
Stop
Also
Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
Good point. Yeah
The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers
Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet
Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability
Cool
♥️🦄
Also
Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false
For sure before snowfall this year
It can tow far more than rated capacity
Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
With production
That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun & shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
Yeah
About 2% of Tesla
Yes
Exactly
They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo
It does so constantly
Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
Three or four months
Good idea ...
That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Tesla AWD is dual motor
Cost of all options
Tesla dual motor
It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners)
Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
You can tweet to Tesla
That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
Also
AC induction front & switched reluctance
Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

Yeah
Yo
Will make that a setting
No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever  …
AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note
Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla
I love it too
Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
Already started DC to NY route.  Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels & faster than jetliner.
Towards end of next year. Btw
This will work on entire S & X fleet
All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth
Yeah
!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.

I am super super serious
I’m starting a candy company & it’s going to be amazing
This will be bigger
I try so hard to help them …
Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short
New Roadster will have that
Yes
It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
Yup
True. And once they were on the call
We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis
Exactly
First
Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
Yeah
To be clear

How many views?
Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
Looking into it now
Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
Similar timing
So probably July
This is kinda nutty for such a short distance
Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.

First time I’ve seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
Maybe that word doesn’t mean what I think it does
Literally never seen it even once
Yeah
I didn’t realize there was one. Will do.
Inconceivable! Who’d say a thing like that!?
What’s Facebook?
Wow
Umm...yes
Yes
I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...

Why Falcon Heavy & Starman?  Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another. There need to be things that inspire you

Probably about a tenth of the cost and a fifth of the time
Want to clarify that as individuals
Higher safety & environmental requirements & labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy & a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost
Wow
End-to-end encryption encoded at firmware level. Unlikely to be hacked w current computing tech. If it is (and we learn about it)

Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
East
No
A Shortfall of Gravitas
A third is under construction
Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2
Of course :)
Maybe that plan works out
That was three years ago
The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were
Now
Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!
We’re doing ok for a bunch of monkeys. Humanity rocks!
Thank you on behalf of SpaceX

Florida time
Falcon Heavy launch simulation almost ready. Will be set to Bowie’s Life on Mars.
Or maybe “Temperature Enhancement Device”
Apparently
Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich
Release candidate in final testing phase
No
I think we’ve figured it out
Yes
Small detail
A snowthrower would be really fun
All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher
Flamethrowers sold out
Of course
Yes
This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn’t hurt the droneship

~3k
So hard to keep future product releases secret
For sure
Coming soon
Sure
Sentience is overrated
But wait
Ok
Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
You’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
Good thing you didn’t ask about the Freezegun ...
Hmmm
Unless you like fun

When the zombie apocalypse happens
Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
Done
Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now
There aren’t even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
Actually
That sounds cool. Will do.
Fixed in next release
Long exposure of rocket ascent
Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.
Gonna put an old school drive-in
Coming very soon
Ok
Sure
Yeah
Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year
Was gonna say we’ll do all but the last
Should be in next update
Done
Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far
Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   So much blood
We will! At least
The circle is complete
Ok
Hats sold out
It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
True
So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations
Yes
Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens …
When you get the new Tesla software update
46k limited edition boring hats sold
I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever
Isn’t it obvious?
If you liked tonight’s launch
It was definitely aliens

However
For the record
Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart
Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.

Meant to say “sanctimonious idiot”
Good point. It’s just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn’t actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an “interview”.

I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future
Red car for a red planet
Yeah
Yes
Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn’t blow up on ascent.
Falcon Heavy to launch next month from Apollo 11 pad at the Cape. Will have double thrust of next largest rocket. Guaranteed to be exciting

Good point
For one thing
Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops
Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.
Sorry
It can transform into a robot
Do you really believe that someone’s life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?

High pain tolerance
Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.
Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand >> supply. Taking action …
The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire & train local team as fast as possible.
Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes & shipping costs vary)
Sounds good
I would be happy to talk. Hopefully
Hell yeah
We should definitely get a room ...
I know that closet is nice and warm
I''m auditioning to be a roofing spokesmodel  in the greater Reno area'
The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like.   Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far

Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That''s what really matters.'
In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

Sorry! Coming next year
Funny thing is
Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
I''m not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don''t think the OPM approach is right.'
The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run

We are going to move all info and settings to the "cloud" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you
Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
Yeah. That''s been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn''t false positive or drain battery.'
Will prob do something like that
Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
Will do. Also
Yeah
Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.

If you buy a ticket to hell
Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events
Yeah
The reality is great highs
Model 3 uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control & lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control
Yes
Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model 3 production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
Yes
Sure
Watched them personally to make sure & I agree with the outcome. Wouldn''t have judged differently. Amazing videos all'
Couldn''t believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they were!!'

An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster
City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O''Hare to downtown. They''ve been great.'
If you want this to happen fast
Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval
For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
Support would be much appreciated!

It''s what you don''t say'
I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
Good point
Fixed. Now it''s good.'
Yes
Stay tuned
I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow :)
Just checked and yes
True. Also
Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
We do that too
Hopefully
Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes
That doesn''t sound right'
Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
Cool!

No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier
Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack & peak heating is the cube of speed
They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
Down the road
Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
Still humans
Significantly improves control force
Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted
We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system
Not only that
Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.

Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly & are reluctant to adopt new tech.
I''ve written two forward-looking master plans'
Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.

We can either give up hope & sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low
The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
Thanks :) Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge & jury system.
Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
Once you add the vintage record player

Don''t know which way Paris will go'
And then some
Yeah
A lot
I do via my foundation
Yes
Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
Yes
There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
Btw
Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another
Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to 5 people.
Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.

Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can''t actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.'
True :)
All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
Early next year. To start with
We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
Can be set higher than that for highways
Exactly
Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
There''s just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.'
HW2. HW1 doesn''t have enough sensors and computing power.'
Hopefully June for those too
S for sure. It is a bigger car.
I''d highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan'
Maybe I''m misinformed'
Yeah
Almost there
That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
Almost there. Probably in a few months.
You can easily turn it off in the car via settings
Something cool for sure
Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.

That''s how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).'
This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.

Simple. I like it.
Kinda like Snoop Dug
I don''t want to be presumptuous'
I know what you''re thinking … then why not "the Third"? Well'
By calling it "the Second"
Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine
Boring Not Boring
Good one
Been done
Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine …
Close-up of rocket stage separation
Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call
Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying
Yeah
Couldn''t agree more'
Extremely
We def want to avoid either
On it now
Great food
Will definitely do that on my next trip
Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard
That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
Yeah
Yes
July
Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months
Next gen Roadster will be convertible
Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
Yeah
Besides
This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
Fairing is ~$5M
Latency should only be 5 min max. Checking ...
Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past
Et tu
Stormy weather in Shortville ...
Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It''s basically dead.'
It''s just a helicopter in helicopter''s clothing'
It won''t matter'
Pretty good
Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you
Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
Working on it
A lot
Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend & Monty Python.
Good point
Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low
Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
Thanks Phil!
Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
If you just downloaded V8.1
On center screen. Also
Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
No
You won''t care'
What gave me away?
No
Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time
We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
Yes
Yes
I believe so
Yup
Oh so little faith
Yeah
Start taking orders in April
Yeah
Only Model S will have the seven seater option
The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
If fate is on our side
No problem :)
Should be summer next year. Sorry
Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it
Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
It still has one display
Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
The more autonomous a car is
How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
Yup
I think so
No
Because I was a dumb idiot and didn''t realize at the time that it would cause confusion'
Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster
Yes
Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series
How about now?
Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
Definitely
Model 3 was going to be called Model E
Yes
Model 3 is just a smaller
Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla
Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
I used to be one. You''re welcome. Trying my best'
Just because I''m building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn''t mean I''m an alien'
The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I''m being optimistic.'
Probably. Either that
I hope that didn''t work'
~spawn npc.alien
Except that isn''t actually my house ...'
Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars
I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
3 is a great car
Good point
I wish. It''s so annoying.'
Finally
Ok
It''s been a bear to get done'
Looking forward to it. I know it''s cliche'
Can only happen with your support
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan
I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter
Ironically
Just spoke with @JayWeatherill
Yes
Will send you one
Self-hatred
Thanks JJ!
This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that''s great'
SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
of course
maybe one of those too
Roller coasters are awesome
Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
Good chance it will
Exactly :)
I didn''t pose for it (hopefully that''s obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better'
Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
no
System was green for launch. I called it off.
They are often right
Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump
Btw
Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak
If this is the only issue
All systems go
Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well
Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok
Yes
It''s much easier to do the CGI that way'
I used that one :)
Ok
They are doing India proud
You may come to regret that request :)
Yeah
Yeah
Apparently
You''re right'
they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
In appreciation
Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing
of course it will
Should all be uploaded by next month
Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
I don''t know what make you think that''s a rocket. It''s completely covered in a tarpaulin...'
yes
Hoping for summer this year
yes
No
Also
No plans to take X
Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
yes
Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
No rare earth metals in battery
Almost ready
App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
Yes
I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That''s where extremism leads.'
Yeah
People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
Rolling out a new update today.
We should try our best
Really? Ok
I just had three coffees :)
Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
Numeric
Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
I love Canada! I''m half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American'
Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
I agree
True. Me being one of them :)
Not perfect & cd be better
Fair point
Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President
Exactly
Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
Good grief
Actually
Isn''t that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.'
Those countries have strong justice systems
Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
You''re right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.'
Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don''t think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.'
Mostly anti-drug laws
Exactly
The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law
The remedy for that is changing the law
Ok
There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don''t know any that are better.'
True!
Many in America don''t realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect'
I wish!
Then so be it. I''d rather do what I believe is right'
Wow
That''s exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.'
Nuances are important :)
Really don''t want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.'
Yes
In addition
At my request
First I''ve heard of this meeting. Will find out why.'
maybe
Yes. Green cards & dual citizens already ok. Work & spousal visas not yet
There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
yes
Headline & article is misleading. I said it won''t be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.'
Yes
I agree with creating great jobs
Yeah
Yes
Strategic & Policy Forum
Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction
It is not
Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They''ve done right'
The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges
This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse
Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
Yeah
Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface
Yup
Maybe next month
Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
I''m just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.'
No they don''t'
Was wondering what those were
Sigh
That may be a difficult award to decline
Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"
... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."
Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: "I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ...
Ok
I share The Economist''s opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise'
Rex is an exceptionally competent executive
This may sound surprising coming from me
There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
3 months maybe
Yes
Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now
Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
For now
Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits
Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
Yes
Unfortunately
Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
Car won''t complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically'
Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
Similar to SpaceX
Not specifically
It might. Am not sure.
Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
One million
Not the ideal ending
There will be many improvements to HW1 over the course of the year
Yes
Yeah
HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars
It does
All satellites deployed
Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
It is
Hopefully
Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down
It will
If the results look good from the latest point release
The least cool characters...it''s embarrassing'
It will in an upcoming release later this year
Tesla''s approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar.'
Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
Longitudinal control will
If all looks good
That was a great game
Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
Late Jan
Yes
Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works
Almost there. Undergoing final validation. Might go out in next few days.
Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
Yes
Brain is full right now and that''s a hard one'
There are some installed already
Good idea
Yes
It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel
Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too
To activate the Model X holiday performance
Looking promising for next week
No major precipitating event
Some years away
Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle
Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
That is actually rolling out to all Model X''s right now'
Yes
8.1
Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well. Just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments.
In work
Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
Should start changing soon
I am actually going to do this
We are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If the site is basically deserted
Boring
It shall be called "The Boring Company"
Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...
You too :)
You''re right'
How do we know this story isn''t fake? Unfortunately'
about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases
yes
at least some of them
That doesn''t make sense. Will look into it.'
About 3 weeks
Backlog of 5 seat foldflat config. 6 seat can be made earlier. Actually my fav version.
Love the pic tho
perfect
That and Paint It Black will both be uploaded for free as Easter (holiday?) eggs
yes
-2
Consequences of population implosion greatly underestimated. Upside down demographic pyramid can''t support social services.'
big mobile app update coming with 8.1 next month
sounds right
Wow
we could enable that
a bit like that
Playing Amish Paradise in my Tesla
Both UV and IR (for heat) reflective. I burn easily & then my nose looks like Rudolph the reindeer
No
I like humanity
there will be something special
Tesla will def absorb SolarCity debt. Altho extremely unlikely
My kids and I are having a great time!
next software update fixes that
might have an early access release ready by then
now wouldn''t that be interesting :)'
hmmm
one day ...
it is not actually left-handed
unless we do a deployable solar shield like a retractable hard top
currently cycles radio favs. Next software release cycles between favs.
no
use buttons on left side of steering wheel
@BBC_TopGear Thanks!
I''m the only author'
I personally like the 6 seat best
We will probably offer that as an option
exactly
Loving this thread :)
Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
In addition
I highly recommend the new all glass roof on the Model S. This was very hard to develop
first solar roof deployments will start next summer
Institutional Shareholder Services
@XHNews Congratulations to China on the successful launch of the LM 5 heavy lift rocket!
There would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a Monte Carlo sim & combining the results to build a map of weaknesses
good chance
yes
yes
strongly net positive
Solar glass tiles can also incorporate heating elements
yes
Should mention that the Tesla solar roof is robust against any weather
Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive
Unveil happening at sunset
Dear cult members
fixing
yeah
AMA at <ahem> 3pm California time
no
yes
When you want your car to return
When searching for parking
yes
8 cameras
Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets
latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade
Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren''t.'
Still working on the video. Fully autonomous drive demo only completed several hours ago.
of course
true and underappreciated
Will post video of a Tesla navigating a complex urban environment shortly. That was what took the extra couple of days.
This is also what I was alluding to by Model 3 part 2
According to experts
This is because the first 12 months of production are sold out
Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.
thanks!
Umm...Autobahn?
obviously wrong
@heiseonline Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
@FortuneMagazine Utter nonsense. Empirical evidence is what matters
Sounds like a great move!
That''s why we need to accelerate solar power'
Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for "subsidies"
impact velocity and center of mass of colliding object make a big difference
Probably not then either
Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most)
I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at 222 million
lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis
Thus I deserve to be top of the target list? Maybe there''s a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more deserving…'
Yeah
When we upgrade the core Linux OS to 4.4
Sabotage of the rocket is unlikely
True
I use twitter for news orgs. My Insta has same women as men. What''s up with the phoney PC police axe-grinding?'
Exactly. Those are the best ones.
Going out this week for X and outside North America
Wow
No irony or uhh "shade" meant here. T''s character is excellent and well-played. Worth seeing.'
Some of the future episodes of Westworld feature my ex. Talulah does a great job of playing a deadly sexbot :)
yes
Will do a Reddit AMA on Mars in the next week or two
Corrective action taken. Seems to be limited to a small number of cases
Am tracking this down ... Super important to be fair. There are zero discounts even for family and friends.
Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.
Three cable elevator on a crane. Wind force on Mars is low
12m rocket booster diameter
yup
yes
yes
pretty close
Chamber pressure is almost 3X Merlin
yes. Also
thanks for ordering a car!
Tesla is sometimes criticized for government support
I read a story about a father whose son died incredibly quickly. Can be as little as half an hour in hot sun.
also
all cars
can''t always detect babies and pets'
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
Yeah
its it is
that''s a great one'
sounds like the right name for the rocket booster
That is my favorite fictional spaceship. Powered by improbability!
yeah!
Maybe Ultimate Spaceship
I love the suggestions!
sounds about right
Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars
yes
won''t affect performance'
Will do some press Q&A on Autopilot post at 11am PDT tmrw and then publish at noon. Sorry about delay. Unusually difficult couple of weeks.
@abadcliche Most likely true
Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
We have not ruled that out.
nope
Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
Support & advice from @NASA
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
It''s been a little crazy lately'
yes. This seems instant from a human perspective
Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to  end of weekend
Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
Not allowed
Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
uh oh
one of my favorite games as a kid
Making progress. Maybe something to announce in a few months. Have played all prior Deus Ex. Not this one yet.
Tesla product announcement at noon California time today
Sunday morning: to bake or not to bake cookies -- that is not even a question. Definitely bake.
Congrats to @TalulahRiley on her novel
true
Would like to thank @nvidia and Jensen for donating the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to @OpenAI in support of democratizing AI technology
Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters
Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
good point
I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y
glad people had a great time!
not bad
Some good guessing by @Jalopnik. The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.
Good summary of yesterday''s Gigafactory Q&A with JB'
Should mention that Gigafactory will be fully powered by clean energy when complete & include battery recycling
happy birthday!
Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
as long as I''m alive'
Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
Jerome is driving Tesla Semi & doing a great job with his team. At Daimler
It''s inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art'
Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
Tesla Master Plan
now 2Pac
California time
Post should go live on Tesla website around 5pm
yup
busted
Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
Lana
Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot & Model 3 today
I am!
Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power)
free Babel fish provided
Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they''re so much smarter than Tesla owners that "they know better". Makes no sense.'
V8 will be our biggest release since v1
It can at moderate range
Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn''t need to be so loud.'
That is a very good point!
Have to focus on tonight''s @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.'
Btw
Promising call today with @BoschGlobal
much appreciated
Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it''s real'
large amounts of crack
6 hours normally
Sunday is the end of the week :)
yes
Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
especially well
Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
Good thing about radar is that
yes
certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
elevation too
only just gained access to physical vehicle
AP process crash would show up in logs
Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud
Maybe didn''t realize he turned it off'
exactly
Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover
can''t wait to see the costume'
@FredericLambert Only if I can play a monkey
Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also
already taken care of
I like your tweets!
US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
Unless we get there and find it isn''t enough. Just won''t be before 1B.'
It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However
With less than 1B miles
Thanks. Point of calling it "beta" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn''t perfect.'
exactly
that wasn''t criticism'
why?
thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
you''re right'
Use of word "beta" is explicitly so that drivers don''t get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense.'
Today is Nikola Tesla''s birthday. I hope he likes what we''ve done in his name.'
Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan
seriously
Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA
thanks
true
No
cool
The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
In other words
Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot
All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out
Exactly! I love Twitter.
If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices
Yes
Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare;  It is enough I may but call her mine.
aspirationally
My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well
Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
cute!
exactly
@mashable We haven''t signed anything for a factory in China'
Deluded
Article is misleading to readers. No one is "taking home" anything. In a stock for stock transaction
Of course. Our love will never die.
Drive units and battery are sealed
If curious abt TSWLM car
We *def* don''t recommended this'
As mentioned at the beginning of the year
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought
Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
Quite rapid... Yes
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
Ascent phase & satellites look good
Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably
Life you can talk to is another matter
No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
That
And
Yeah
Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
That is correct. It was about innovation.
no
yes
S and X cells are also Panasonic
Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model 3 cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
PC
@Recode I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
how did you know?
Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
exactly
It is simulations all the way down
At this point
control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
Yay
autosteering chutes will be added soon
Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this & investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core
Satellite deployed to 91
There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk
Flight 24 is def capable of flying again
No prob. We care about doing what''s fair & just. Don''t always get it right'
Per the letter
Yes
We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of
Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs
Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9
Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
Better. Not there yet
yes
yup
Most recent rocket took max damage
will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
también te amo
It''s probably the Ambien'
@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
@LifeOfRockstar I think so
Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14
@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
Yeah
May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time
Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible
@samsamlee777 yes
Filtering particulates from air makes a significant & measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily
@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
@SacEV next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
@_andyoneal sides def
@CyberdineX naturally
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It''s a beast...'
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@mattyteare Basically current
@dannysparker yes
@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn''t need securing'
@Mini_Elon yes
@vicentes @gdoehne yes
@jbdeck for sure :)
@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn''t (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world''s best researchers.'
@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission
@vigneshraju of course
@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren''t many used Teslas available. Demand >> supply.'
@erothenberg checking into it ...
@romn8tr will definitely do so
@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others
@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem
But wouldn''t recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn''t be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.'
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable
@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months
@RealDarthBL We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
Have recently come to appreciate the awesome
@ID_AA_Carmack me too!
@lonelysandwich needs latest update
Activate autopilot 4X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And
@drew @SpaceX Not from us
@thelonelyisland Well
@TheHackersNews @SpaceX Thanks
@rjcc yes
@levie Tickets to orbital hotels
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla
@POTUS Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
@Jon_Favreau @SpaceX Thanks!
@NASA @sgvcrime @SpaceX @Space_Station Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
@arstechnica Reasons for ocean landing are technical
@nonesuchzach Nickel is also in nickels
@nonesuchzach Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel
Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two
@samboykin @danahull the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
@jpfrappier yes
@Recode Dex will do comms
@maximumblue we will
@LaurenShearer1 Doesn''t sound right. Will check into it.'
@MThorpXXi We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X
@Brianmrtz probably unwise
@Christiano92 @Inspron @Jerry22499879 won''t be a hatchback'
@stevehurd yes
@Jerry22499879 yes
@qa2198 @TeslaMotors yes
@GoesAzedo yes
@morganpage sounds good
Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw
@lordsshrivas Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
@GonzaloBolio yes
@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what''s the link to that?'
@tapwin No
@mpatfield no problem
@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
@AndersRytter yes
@AlexBelohlavek less
And
Model 3 will be RWD
@GolfsHard yes
@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
@iKrivetko that''s not the real steering system'
@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography
In general
@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
@WaltNew cool
@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes
276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
@grebakshay We are working on an exact date
@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
@vicentes Roadster
@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered
@raytech247 yes
@squallcraft and a few other things
Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total
253k as of 7am this morning
@sundarpichai thanks!
Now 232k orders
@GrahamABlair of course :)
@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily)
@steveagee def on the cards for the future
@JackLipstone should be within a week or two max
@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa
Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
Thought it would slow way down today
@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network
@Oatmeal sure!
@StartUpRabbi Coming in the mail
@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
@drew Just order the SpaceX option package!
Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level
@lukealization yes
@preastro yes
@KentNStephens sure is
@roddrury X and S will also be available
Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details
Model 3 orders
@haerone From almost anywhere
@GiftedDiego Coming soon!
Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won''t be disappointed. Also'
@rossbin You will see the car very clearly
Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2
@MileHighWillY being fixed
@RobGlaser sure
@mikegaalsf Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service
@Christianlguaje no
The AEI meeting wasn''t secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.'
SpaceX & Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don''t outsource manufacturing'
SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also
Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn''t expect this one to work (v hot reentry)'
@Astro_Valdric @TeslaMotors We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
.@curtismcauliff SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
@chrisdbond checking ...
@lorengrush exactly :)
@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn''t sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.'
@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row
@derekslager @skiesforme yes
@skiesforme Can''t emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also'
@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said
@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
@RoMcLocko @TeslaMotors coming later this year
@elliegoulding Hi :)
@msb17 yeah
@AnnaDotBlue Little bit
Worth watching "Nathan for You" on Comedy Central
@BasseyE @tegmark yes
Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That''s basically what formulas are.'
@chriskreidler @engadget yes
More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That''s it for now.'
@MysteryGuitarM yes
No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
@garethseneque global
@ErikRoesegg good point
Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
@TheEconomist Interesting name
@Benzinga I didn''t take anyone''s car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.'
@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff
Falcon lands on droneship
@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage
@JimmyVosika Actually
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before
@mbhnyc steel collet
Well
@Uncle_Gus probably
However
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall
Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
In ~2 years
Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door
First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
Worth reading The Machine Stops
Falcon 9 back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found
@morganpage thanks!
@Jon_Favreau Thanks Jon!
11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
Static fire test looks good. Pending data review
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence …
About 2 mins from static fire
@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
5 mins from static fire test
@lukealization yes
@craigcocca It worked in Texas
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the 16th and launch about three days later
@laulauritzen Agreed. Working on it.
@NASA Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
@MikeBloomberg Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
@ID_AA_Carmack Yep
@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
Getting to space needs ~Mach 3
It is
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
@levie Sounds perfect
@StartupLJackson Yeah and hell yeah
@atduarte From anywhere
Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested
@drew definitely aliens!
@kevinmitnick Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
@BjornNyland @TeslaMotors well done!
@ID_AA_Carmack noted
@GertAbildskov Wow
@MacTechGenius yes
Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated
@anakinSGE Hopefully
@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand
@abrax4s Yes
@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
These are all things I''ve said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability'
Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
My comments in China weren''t transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars & batteries in CA & NV as far into future as I can imagine.'
@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade
@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
Regulatory approvals received
@JarkkoKuoppala all
@backseatdiver Hoping for Friday release
@elonmusk Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
@sAlmaneei already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
@bonnienorman thanks Bonnie :)
@M4XRodri planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
@octomagon me too:
@jonthomason yay! Always happy to make others happy
@thebradholt big UI update coming in V7.1
@ryybuzz we won''t be'
Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important
Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
@drew already there
Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.
@Meddd__ @aaronpaul_8 Watched the whole series. One of the best tv shows ever.
@aaronpaul_8 um
@aaronpaul_8 sure :)
@elimelechweiss actually works best at night
@roymoody Depends on regulatory approval
@MRamseyWSJ 1.5 million miles per day
@aikisteve @andrewshiamone V7.1
@lordsshrivas Lots of upgrades and a new look
@heosat ww
@madolfsson roughly 5 days
@MPa81 @bonnienorman same
@TeslaPittsburgh Non-autopilot will have a new interface too. More comprehensive UI update coming with 7.1.
@andrewshiamone yes
Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version 7 software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
CH4 rapidly decays back to CO2 & is absorbed by plants. What matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil
@HamiltonOfiyai Intentions are good
@appleinsider I didn''t walk back anything'
@YoApp yo
Regarding the watch
Yo
@stumplahoma @mashable door is larger than opening and acts as an umbrella. Upper interior trim has hydrophobic coating.
@sasatokic @mashable Front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
Model X Bioweapon Defense Mode definitely filters viruses btw
@achailleux am def 6''2"'
CNN on how Falcon doors work in tight garages. Above 6 2'' ft'
@johnzabroski thanks
Btw
@elonmusk California time
@deadmau5 It was super good
In expendable mode
Dragon 2 is designed to land on any surface (liquid or solid) in the solar system. Am glad to see people thinking about applications!
@Sethrogen thanks!
Btw
First production cars will be handed over on Sept 29 at our Fremont factory
@ScottLucasNV Definitely
@ScottLucasNV Lithium deal is not exclusive & has many contingencies. The press on this matter is unwarranted.
@elonmusk $35k price
Model 3
With same options
@Forbes I appreciate the kind words in the article
True
@BjornNyland Provided all ten take delivery
@CatherineMotuz yes
The car will learn over time
@tallakt Various forms of shades are being considered. May not be necessary though.
@alipoursamar all regions
Final corner case is dealing with low contrast lane markings (faded white on grey concrete) while driving into the sun at dusk
Almost ready to release highway autosteer and parallel autopark software update
@Alyssa_Milano Thanks Alyssa!
@loic thanks Loic :)
@ID_AA_Carmack Even if inevitable
If you’re against a military AI arms race
@kevinmitnick probably end of year
Ludicrous speed
Model S product call at 11 today. Rocket discussion at noon on Monday.
Expect to reach preliminary conclusions regarding last flight by end of week. Will brief key customers & FAA
Cause still unknown after several thousand engineering-hours of review. Now parsing data with a hex editor to recover final milliseconds.
@DavidBrin Thanks David
@adventFuturist yeah
That''s all we can say with confidence right now. Will have more to say following a thorough fault tree analysis.'
There was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Data suggests counterintuitive cause.
@juanmlemao Thanks :)
Falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage shutdown. Will provide more info as soon as we review the data.
@NoMansSky You''re welcome. Good conversation.'
@connollyjeff1 @TheStreet End of year
Important to note that Model S resale value is also higher than that of gasoline cars
To be clear
My kids love "The Lost Planet" by @RachelSearles. Now on a rare second read!
@kpe @SpaceX @grierallen @natedapore Cool
What are the best riddles you''ve heard that are short enough for Twitter?'
This is not the full Gigafactory
@jankenbrandt Hi Julie!
@ChristieNic Thanks Christie
@TeslaP85D That is true. If someone says they are thinking about having kids
It is total BS & hurtful to claim that I told a guy to miss his child''s birth just to attend a company meeting. I would never do that.'
@voxdotcom I have never written or said this. Ashlee''s book was not independently fact-checked. Should be taken w a grain of salt.'
Max acceleration was 6X gravity
While I like the initials
@romn8tr Press conference went way over time. Tried to give all the journalists who''d traveled far an opportunity to ask a question.'
For more info on Tesla Energy
@bonnienorman Haha
For the future to be good
Rocket launch good
Worth watching @ExMachinaMovie. The AI would be in the network
@bonnienorman New Roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of July
@andrewket @TeslaRoadTrip Wow!
While the rocket does look rather tall & tippy
Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.
@Aero4Real I only invest in companies I help found or to help a friend or a cause (no return expected for latter two)
Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.
High resolution
If this works
Ok
Looks like Falcon landed fine
Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship
3 mins to liftoff
Launch window always tight when orbital synch needed. In this case
Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
Have asked SolarCity if we can do something philanthropic with the CA aqueducts to help the water crisis. Investigating…
@benfeldman63 Thanks!
We debated this
Waited to say something until after we fixed some of the options pricing (too high) and colors (too many similar)
To land a rocket
Battery "breakthroughs" need to state power *and* energy density (not the same thing)
Welcome @Chiefboltkennyh to @TeslaMotors. He will apply Formula 1 techniques to revolutionize servicing mainstream cars.
@johngreen @hankgreen You had me at Sheen or Gaddafi. Must admit to liking "The Fault in Our Stars" too. Sad
With all that solar power being generated
SolarCity just hit a new daily energy record of 5GWh two weeks after reaching 4GWh
Major new Tesla product line -- not a car -- will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio on Thurs 8pm
Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast
Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater
Contrary to press reports
Maybe it''s wrong'
Reading Look to Windward by Banks. He is an amazing writer. Pantheon level.
@AbeAlem Unfortunately
@Pandoomic Just changed them to full public domain
However
To be clear
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future
Neither I nor the company are selling shares. Even if we were
Some people seem to think I tweet to affect share price. This is false. A brief rise in $TSLA stock obviously does no good for Tesla or me.
The ancient Egyptians were amazing
The rumor that I''m building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue'
Btw
Seems like an opportune moment to bring up the Fermi Paradox
There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway
Upgrades in the works to allow landing for geo missions: thrust +15%
Both satellites deployed on target. Now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over Europe & Asia.
Next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now. Tonight''s flight and following one will not have enough propellant.'
Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
Can''t delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.'
Mega storm preventing droneship from remaining on station
Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape
Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes …
Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles
If you are curious about the P85D
P85 acceleration will also improve
Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great
And pls don''t ask me about space elevators  until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge'
Reason is Newton''s Third Law. In vacuum'
If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn''t use an electric rocket to reach orbit'
West Coast droneship under construction will be named "Of Course I Still Love You"
Good primer on the exponential advancement of technology
@thomasmuirhead Good piece
@elonmusk ... In honor of IMB
Repairs almost done on the spaceport drone ship and have given it the name "Just Read the Instructions"
The universe is really
@trakz @TheSimpsons Of course!
Next rocket landing on drone ship in 2 to 3 weeks w way more hydraulic fluid. At least it shd explode for a diff reason.
@ID_AA_Carmack Rocket hits hard at ~45 deg angle
@ID_AA_Carmack Before impact
@ID_AA_Carmack Tks. Turns out we recovered some impact video frames from drone ship. It''s kinda begging to be released…'
@FormulaSAE Contact Steve Davis at Hyperloop@spacex.com
Also thinking of having an annual student Hyperloop pod racer competition
Will be building a Hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. Most likely in Texas.
@alankerlin Hydraulics are usually closed
Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship
Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit.
Launching in one minute
Need to investigate the upper stage Z actuator. Was behaving strangely. Next launch attempt on Friday at 5am.
Btw
Reading The Culture series by Banks. Compelling picture of a grand
Nothing against all the oatmeal-raisin cookies out there. Just be yourself.
Really should be a rule that oatmeal-raisin cookies can''t look too much like choc chip. Doppelgänger cookie trickery!'
Pack swap now operating in limited beta mode for SF to LA route. Can swap battery faster than visiting a gas station. Tesla blog out soon.
Dune series by Herbert also brilliant. He advocates placing limits on machine intelligence.
Reread Asimov''s Foundation series. Brilliant.'
Welcome back @RicardoR to run the @TeslaMotors communications team!
@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon
The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. Maybe flight 21.
Really hate it when companies bring out an awesome show car and then you can never actually buy it. So lame.
Rumors about canceling Falcon wing doors are false. At Tesla
@Shmizer1 unfettered certainly and at very low cost
SpaceX is still in the early stages of developing advanced micro-satellites operating in large formations. Announcement in 2 to 3 months.
Deepest sympathies to the families of the pilots and the Virgin Galactic team
Sorry to hear about the @OrbitalSciences launch. Hope they recover soon.
Also
Article in @WSJ re Tesla sales is incorrect. September was a record high WW and up 65% year-over-year in North America.
Was going to work out this morning. Went to IHOP instead.
Kinda trippy seeing myself on @SouthPark. I''ve watched the show ever since the J vs SC short. Brian Boitano!'
Just got word that the cumulative miles of the  worldwide Tesla fleet passed half a billion!
I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No
“@TheDailyShow: The House Science
@TalulahRiley Good suggestion :)
Would also like to congratulate @Boeing
Deeply honored and appreciative of the trust that @NASA has placed in @SpaceX for the future of human spaceflight
Official Gigafactory address to be: Electric Avenue
@Salina_Snipes sounds about right
Just did crazy Japanese game show called 逆転の法則. I have no idea what happened
@yoshimasa_satoh It was exactly what I was looking for
Launch in ~1.5 hours if weather clears. Lightning tower struck earlier
Model S limits torque if brake & accel simul pressed. Going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.
@cermak @Tesla_Europe I agree. We are fixing this plan. Updated map coming soon.
@WillOremus That has been my goal from the beginning. Need the Gigafactory for Model 3.
Three engine F9R Dev1 vehicle auto-terminated during test flight. No injuries or near injuries. Rockets are tricky …
@awadsayeed Yes. Technically Model 3 or maybe three horizontal bars. Won''t be three vertical bars.'
@BillGates @RyanSeacrest @TEDchris Am a bit under the weather
Model S drivetrain warranty increased to infinite miles
Hope we''re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately'
While on the subject of AI risk
@drwave @itsDanielSuarez Yeah
@IrrelevantGamer @masseffect Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games ever. Also love Saints Row IV.
Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.
Guardians of the Galaxy is great. Best line is when Star-Lord says his spaceship looks like a Jackson Pollock painting under black light.
On annual camping trip w kids. Trying a place just south of Carmel in California this year.
Looks like body slam
Detailed review of rocket telemetry needed to tell if due to initial splashdown or subsequent tip over and body slam
Rocket booster reentry
@leroytwin @Tesla_Canada A lot of Canadian Superchargers are in work and will start going live in the next month or so
Goal is for unsubsidized solar power to cost less than grid electricity from coal or fracked gas
Edmunds beats Tesla LA-NY record by several hours! “@edmunds: Made it! Our Model S made LA-NY run in 67 hrs and 21 mins"
Apparently
@Ash_Dale I do seriously need a haircut :)
Ok
@QuantumG When we launch I want to know that SpaceX has done everything possible to keep the astronauts safe. Only a few more years to go.
@QuantumG Dragon V1.1 doesn''t have a launch escape system. Probably comparable reliability to Shuttle'
@RichardGarriott Just the air in Dragon. Technically
@westcoastbill First
Either way
Reason I believe this is likely is that Correll first tried to work at SpaceX
@Oatmeal may all technology in the future follow the zeroth law...
@Oatmeal I would be happy to help
Worth seeing @ChefTheFilm by @Jon_Favreau. Make sure to plan for a meal afterwards!
Cover drops on May 29. Actual flight design hardware of crew Dragon
Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed
@micahgtb almost
@constrainedbyc no problem
@nitroc3ll yes
@KAlHomoud Superchargers in Canada will go live in 6 to 8 weeks. Update on forums shortly.
Flight computers continued transmitting for 8 seconds after reaching the water. Stopped when booster went horizontal.
Data upload from tracking plane shows landing in Atlantic was good! Several boats enroute through heavy seas.
Orbit insertion and Dragon deploy all good. Falcon reentry burn also good. Waiting for landing data from tracking plane.
@erwinEmm Need to make sure precision return from hypersonic velocity works in ocean before transitioning to land
This is 1st ever orbital rocket launch w landing legs. Will attempt leg deploy & soft landing out to sea.
@elonmusk Also
Leasing a Model S takes 5 mins online
@AKAbrahamson @itsDanielSuarez Yeah
@MarinaSBlinova @MikeJudge @Recode That would definitely help
@justincooperman @MikeJudge @Recode Yeah
Bloomberg article today also has oddly false details. I don''t eat breakfast at Tesla and drink coffee'
The @MikeJudge show about Silicon Valley missed the mark in some ways
Some oddly inaccurate news stories of late ...
@BKuppersmith Coming soon
@OlejAndersen Once 5.9 is rolled out to the whole fleet and all looks good
@OlejAndersen Some challenges w 5.9 rollout
@FlateFred agreed
Russian state TV threatens US with nuclear war
Working on a Model S environmental impact blog this weekend to counteract BS like the @Bloomberg graphite story. Beyond ridiculous...
@jnags92 Yes
@TeamAizek Not true. The amount of graphite in our car is small
@X4NWO Well
@gordon_tindall Yeah
@TeslaRoadTrip Thanks
About to testify before Senate against ULA (Lockheed and Boeing) monopoly contract for national security launches

@simonhackett Yes
@arcaresenal true
Rest in peace
View of Earth from upper stage rear view camera at 8
Restart was good
Reached parking orbit. Now coasting towards equator
About an hour away from launch. I''d like to thank @SES_Satellites for taking a chance on @SpaceX. We''ve given it our all.'
@toruonu cool :)
@TierraUniversu It was fixed this weekend
@TierraUniversu The writer of this article had a problem with his 12V battery
@TierraUniversu Doesn''t sound right. If it is'
German govt reviews Tesla Model S fires. All due to high speed impacts
All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit
Rocket engines are healthy
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.
@lomac92 @WIRED No
Don''t actually mean to knock Honda -- their cars are solid -- but the park outside (or yr house might burn down) advice was awesome'
@AdamMKE Model S can seat 5 adults
...but only if you like your house "Honda recalls Fit for fire risk
Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful
At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
In other news
Rocket flight to 744m
@DebbieViviers @SpaceX Yes
Between this flight & Grasshopper tests
Rocket booster relit twice (supersonic retro & landing)
Looks good for a launch attempt today. Upper winds slightly exceed loads in high subsonic regime
Falcon 9 launch window is Sunday and Monday
Engineers interested in working on autonomous driving
Intense effort underway at Tesla to develop a practical autopilot system for Model S
Will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good & AF needs to test ICBMs
Full thrust achieved on 2 sec static fire. Some anomalies to be investigated
Upcoming Falcon 9 demo has a lot of new technology
@Jon_Favreau Yup. We saw it in the movie and made it real. Good idea!
Will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures & then immediately printing it in titanium
And
@brynmooser Reality is the best illusion
We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.
Same rocket flight
Latest rocket test flight: hard lateral deviation

@John_Gardi your guess is the closest I''ve seen anyone guess so far. Pod diameter probably around 2m'
@schadlu I really hate patents unless critical to company survival. Will publish Hyperloop as open source.
@TobiasVdb Yes
Will publish Hyperloop alpha design by Aug 12. Critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.
Just completed full mission duration firing of next gen Falcon 9 booster. V proud of the boost stage team for overcoming many tough issues.
@BrianDunning @SpaceX New spacesuit almost done. Hoping to unveil by end of year.

@LisaRoutel The NY auto dealers lost in court
Tesla pack swap vid still being edited (multiple camera angles). In meantime
Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars
@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap)
Live pack swap demo on Thurs night at 8pm California time at our design studio in Hawthorne. Seeing is believing.
Battery storage of solar power needed for night operation & to buffer grid during day. Beta projects are going well.
A long way to go before most power generation is solar
@mcrsqr True
Easier said than done. There is a lot of pressure from investors. It is hard not to feel super bad if u don''t make ur qtr.'
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+
@SQMInc I don''t have a publicist'
No near term plans to IPO @SpaceX. Only possible in very long term when Mars Colonial Transporter is flying regularly.
Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in
1st firing of Falcon 9-R advanced prototype rocket. Over 1M lbs thrust
@RobertGaristo V much agree. Moreover
Am thinking of doing a movie "sequel" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv
Yeah
Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change
@1stHubbleFan @keithwarren Exactly
In reality
Climate change deniers claim "scientists disagree"
Was beat up pretty badly as a kid & left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older
Had a minor operation
Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling
Technically
If consumption is low
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No
Net of gas savings
Yes
Trees are net consumers of CO2
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don''t ban a purchase'
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair
Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl)
@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn''t necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.'

@enggirl Mostly water or coffee at home. When I''m out'
@danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything.
@JasonPolstein Yeah
@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen Given the extreme burn
@RaimisJ Tesla software knits together Google Voice
@dpinsen People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don''t know if true'
Would also recommend the Cheese Shop
Hold down voice button & say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet.
@realbhuwan Don''t forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.'
There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
@mjasandoval Stay tuned
Just want to say thanks to customers & investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long
@westcoastbill Thanks Bill!

A123 battery company renames itself B456 after bankruptcy (really).
Recovery ship has secured Dragon. Powering down all secondary systems. Cargo looks A ok.
Telemetry says main parachutes deployed ... now visually confirmed
Recovery ship just heard the sonic booms from Dragon reentry and has data transmission lock.
Dragon deorbit burn was good. All thrusters operating. On target for splashdown.
Future will indeed be rooftop solar + battery pack
Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
Really exciting @TeslaMotors announcement coming on Thursday. Am going to put my money where my mouth is in v major way.
There''s crazy'
@MichaelLindahl It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW 3 vs Model S being S7 or M5
@DeanJFalkenberg yep
@Nezheim @jbmeicher sure :)
But when considering savings of gas v electricity
